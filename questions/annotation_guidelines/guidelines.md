# Annotation Guidelines

The identification of phrases and terms to label require to establish annotation guidelines that are as consistent as possible in term extractions. At first, we define some linguistic terminologies, since we observed no overall agreement for all of them in the literature.

<em>Category</em>: Information categories are Biological Named Entity Types, e.g., ORGANISM or ENVIRONMENT. In related work, sometimes the term "entity" is used for entity types.

<em>Entity</em>: Entities are instances of Entity Types, e.g., "Atlantic Ocean" [LOCATION] or "forest" [ENVIRONMENT]. An entity is an artifact with an assigned category. In literature, we sometimes encounter the term "mention" for entities.

<em>Artifact</em>: We denote an artifact as a phrase or term that has been identified for categorization (based on the guidelines described below) but that has not been classified yet.

<em>Noun Entity</em>: Noun entities are proper nouns and common nouns that can either consist of one word or several words (e.g., compound nouns). Proper nouns name specific things and always begin with a capital letter, e.g., "Europe", "Apis mellifera" (honeybee), "CO2". Common nouns are generic nouns that do not name specific things, such as water, grassland and aquifer.

<em>Nested Entity</em>: Since noun entities might consist of several words such as "benthic oxygen uptake rate" all nested terms are defined as "nested entities", e.g., "benthic", "oxygen".
