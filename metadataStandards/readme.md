# metadata_standard_2020.csv

This file provides additional information about the selection process. All standards were obtained in September 2020 from re3data (https://www.re3data.org/) and RDA (https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/).
In re3data, we filtered  for "Life Sciences" and in RDA, we selecetd all top-level standards labeled with "Science". We merged and cleaned the list according to the following criteria: We ommitted deprecated standards, file formats, standards from clinical trails, astrophysics and astronomy.
