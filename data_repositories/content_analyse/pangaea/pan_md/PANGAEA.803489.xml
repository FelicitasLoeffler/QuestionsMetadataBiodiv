The period between about 380 000 and 220 000 years BP seems to have been one of major volcanic activity. During the volcanic activity there were periods of ice cover probably of short duration. The oldest evidence of glacial action predates a lava flow dated at between 340 000 and 380 000 years. At about 290 000 years an ice cap of a thickness of at least 100 m covered the summit area and one or a series of subglacial eruption(s) led to the formation of palagonitic breccia. This event was probably associated with a complete melting of the ice since it was followed almost immediately by the eruption of a thick sequence of normal lava flows which range in age from about 289 000 years to about 220 000 years. Subsequent volcanic activity was less significant and no dates are available on this.</md:MetaData/md:abstract><md:MetaData/md:project/md:label /><md:MetaData/md:event/md:label>MtGiluwe</md:MetaData/md:event/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:comment /><md:MetaData/md:license/md:label>CC-BY-3.0</md:MetaData/md:license/md:label><md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent /><md:MetaData/md:reference/md:title /><date>1976-12-04T20:37:40</date></data>
