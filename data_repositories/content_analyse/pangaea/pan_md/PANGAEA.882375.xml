Physical and chemical aerosol properties differ conspicuously during the episodic impact of an outstanding low pressure system in 2015 (LPS15) compared to the prevailing clear sky conditions (CSC): The about three days persisting LPS15, located in the eastern Weddell Sea, was associated with marine boundary layer (MBL) air mass intrusion, enhanced condensation particle concentrations (1400&#177;700 cm-3 compared to 250&#177;120 cm-3 during CSC, mean &#177; SD), occurrence of a new particle formation (NPF) event exhibiting a continuous growth of particle diameters (Dp) from 12 nm to 43 nm over 44 hours (growth rate 0.6 nm h-1), peaking methane sulfonate (MS-), non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO42-) and Na+ concentrations (190 ng m-3 MS-, 137 ng m-3 nss-SO42-, and 53 ng m-3 Na+ compared to 24&#177;15 ng m-3, 107&#177;20 ng m-3 and 4.1&#177;2.2 ng m-3, respectively, during CSC), and finally an increased MS-/nss-SO42- mass ratio &#223;MS of 0.4 up to 2.3 (0.21&#177;0.1 during CSC) comparable to typical values found at coastal Antarctic sites. Throughout the observation period a larger part of MS- could be found in super micron aerosol compared to nss-SO42-, i.e. (10&#177;2) % by mass compared to (3.2&#177;2) %, respectively. On the whole, during CSC aged aerosol characterized by an usually mono-modal size distribution around Dp = 60 nm was observed. Although our observations indicate that sporadic impacts of coastal cyclones were associated with enhanced marine aerosol entry, at large aerosol deposition on-site during austral summer should be dominated by the typical steady CSC.</md:MetaData/md:abstract><md:MetaData/md:project/md:label>AWI_AC</md:MetaData/md:project/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:label>Kohnen</md:MetaData/md:event/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:comment
