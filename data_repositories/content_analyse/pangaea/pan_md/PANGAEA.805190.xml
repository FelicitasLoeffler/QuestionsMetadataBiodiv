Leg 162 (North Atlantic-Arctic Gateways II) recovered ash layers at Sites 982, 985, and 907 (Jansen, Raymo, Blum, et al., 1996, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.ir.162.1996). The revisited Site 907 was first drilled during Leg 151, and the ash from this site has been described in detail by Lacasse et al. (1996, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.sr.151.122.1996) and Werner et al. (1996, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.sr.151.123.1996). Site 982 is located within the Hatton-Rockall Basin on the Rockall Plateau, which is situated west of the British Isles. Site 985 is located northeast of Iceland at the foot of the eastern slope of the Iceland Plateau, adjacent to the Norwegian Basin. Here we report chemical analyses of Neogene tephra layers from Holes 982A, 983B, 982C, 985A, and 985B.The sedimentary sequence at Site 982 spans the lower Miocene-Holocene, Site 985 recovered sediments spanning the upper Oligocene-Holocene. Twenty-two distinct ash layers and ash-bearing sediments were sampled in Holes 982A-982C (Cores 162-982A-16H through 24H, 162-982B-14H through 56X, and 162-982C-15H through 27H), and 59 ash layers were sampled in Holes 985A and 985B (Cores 162-985A-11H through 59X, and 162-985B-11H through 14H). Almost 50% of the sampled ash is strongly altered (predominantly from Site 985). A cluster of altered thin layers in the lower Pliocene of Site 985 (top of Unit III) is remarkable.</md:MetaData/md:abstract><md:MetaData/md:project/md:label>ODP</md:MetaData/md:project/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:label /><md:MetaData/md:event/md:comment /><md:MetaData/md:license/md:label>CC-BY-3.0</md:MetaData/md:license/md:label><md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent>Sample code/label | Sample label | ODP sample designation | Sample ID | AL = discrete ash layer, DA = disseminated ash layer, EL = ash-enriched layer | Layer description | Layer | mbsf | Depth, top/min | Depth top | Depth, bottom/max | Depth bot | corrected | Depth, composite top | Depth c top | Depth, composite bottom | Depth c bot | Depth, composite | Depth comp | ash layer | Layer thickness | Thickness | colorless glass abundance: | Glasses | Thin section estimated | colorless glass: v = vesicular shards, bw = bubble-wall shards, p = pumice fragments, bl = blocky shards (in order of relative amount) | Glass type | brown glass abundance: | brown glass: v = vesicular shards, bw = bubble-wall shards, p = pumice fragments, bl = blocky shards (in order of relative amount) | correlative samples | Comment | Sample comment | * = layer that contains one to three glass fragments with differing chemical compositions (not listed here) | fr. = fraction, hetero. = layer that contains chemically heterogeneous glass fragments | number of analyzed particles (f) and total number of analyses (p) | Method comment | Method comm | Silicon dioxide | SiO2 | CAMECA electron microprobe | Silicon dioxide, standard deviation | SiO2 std dev | Titanium dioxide | TiO2 | Titanium dioxide, standard deviation | TiO2 std dev | Aluminium oxide | Al2O3 | Aluminium oxide, standard deviation | Al2O3 std dev | total Fe as FeO+Fe2O3 | Iron oxide, FeO | FeO | Iron oxide, FeO, standard deviation | FeO std dev | Manganese oxide | MnO | Manganese oxide, standard deviation | MnO std dev | Magnesium oxide | MgO | Magnesium oxide, standard deviation | MgO std dev | Calcium oxide | CaO | Calcium oxide, standard deviation | CaO std dev | Sodium oxide | Na2O | Sodium oxide, standard deviation | Na2O std dev | Potassium oxide | K2O | Potassium oxide, standard deviation | K2O std dev | Phosphorus oxide | P2O5 | Phosphorus oxide, standard deviation | P2O5 std dev | vol. free | Elements, total | total | Sulfur dioxide | SO2 | Sulfur dioxide, standard deviation | SO2 std dev | Fluorine | F | Fluorine, standard deviation | F std dev | Chlorine | Cl | Chlorine, standard deviation | Cl std dev</md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent><md:MetaData/md:reference/md:title /><date>1999-01-14T13:44:45</date></data>
