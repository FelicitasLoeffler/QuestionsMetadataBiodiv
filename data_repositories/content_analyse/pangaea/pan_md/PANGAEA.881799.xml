The 48 experimental plant communities included twelve monocultures (of which one was removed from all analyses because it was planted with the wrong species), twelve 2-species mixtures, twelve 4-species mixtures and twelve 8-species mixtures. We used two community-evolution treatments (plant histories), plants with eight years of co-selection history in different plant communities in the Jena Experiment (communities of co-selected plants) and plants without such co-selection history (na&#239;ve communities). Community-level plant productivity was measured each year from 2012 to 2015 by collecting species-specific aboveground biomass at the time of peak biomass in spring, whereas the traits plant height and SLA were measured once in 2015.We harvested plant material 3 cm aboveground from a 50 x 20 cm area in the centre of each half-quadrat, sorted it into species, dried it at 70&#176;C and weighed the dry biomass. At the end of the experiment, in May 2015, we measured plant height and SLA for 30 species in neutral soil. For each species, we collected up to 20 representative leaves (depending on the leaf size of the species) from four individuals and measured the leaf area by scanning fresh leaves immediately after harvest and determining the mass of the same leaves after drying.</md:MetaData/md:abstract><md:MetaData/md:project/md:label>JenExp</md:MetaData/md:project/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:label /><md:MetaData/md:event/md:comment /><md:MetaData/md:license/md:label>CC-BY-3.0</md:MetaData/md:license/md:label><md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent>block in the Jena experiment, in total 4 blocks | Block | plot in the Jena experiment, in total 48 plots | Experimental plot | sowed species richness | Species richness | S | Species | Functional group | Functional gr | Replicates | Repl | above-ground community history | History | Number of leaves | Leaves | of non-reproductive plant part | Height | h | of either shoot, flowering stem or leaf | Height, maximum | Height max | scanned | Leaf area | LA | dried | Leaf, dry mass | Leaf d m | Leaf area, specific | LA spec | year of harvest | Date | soil treatments | Treatment | Treat | number of legume species present in plot | Legumes | number of tall herb species present in plot | Herbs, tall | Herbs tall | number of  small herb  species present in plot | Herbs, small | Herbs small | number of grass species present in plot | Grasses | community aboveground biomass per half-quadrat, harvested at peak biomass, clipped 3 cm aboveground and dried at 70 &#176;C for &gt;
