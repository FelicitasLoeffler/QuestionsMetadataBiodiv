A multibeam survey was conducted in the eastern Weddell Sea at a potential earthquake area, located east of Fimbul Canyon. The tracks complemented data from former expeditions and extended the surveyed area to 60 by 80 NM. Data were achieved during the transit to the eastern Weddell Sea and by several wide spaced track lines at the continental margin east of Antarctic Peninsula. Between 66&#176;30'S and 67&#176;S a systematic survey of about 35 by 40 NM was carried out at a slump area. The multibeam sonar system Hydrosweep DS-2 was operated using 59 beams and 90&#176; aperture angle. The refraction correction was achieved utilizing the system's own cross fan calibration. The quality of data might be reduced during bad weather periods or adverse sea ice conditions. The dataset contains raw data that are not processed and thus may contain errors and blunders in depth and position.</md:MetaData/md:abstract><md:MetaData/md:project/md:label>AWI_Paleo</md:MetaData/md:project/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:label>PS61/2-track</md:MetaData/md:event/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:comment /><md:MetaData/md:license/md:label /><md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent /><md:MetaData/md:reference/md:title>Die Expedition ANTARKTIS XIX mit FS Polarstern 2001/2002 Bericht von den Fahrtabschnitten 1 und 2 (The Expedition ANTARKTIS XIX of RV Polarstern in 2001/2002 reports of legs 1 and 2)</md:MetaData/md:reference/md:title><date>2004-09-04T09:44:16</date></data>
