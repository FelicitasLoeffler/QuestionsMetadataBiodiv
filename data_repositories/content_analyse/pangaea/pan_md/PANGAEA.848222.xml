An analysis based on strength and cohesion from ring shear experiments</md:MetaData/md:citation/md:supplementTo/md:title><md:MetaData/md:abstract>The upper shelf of the landslide-prone Ligurian Margin (Western Mediterranean Sea) off Nice well-known for the 1979 Airport Landslide is a natural laboratory to study preconditioning factors and trigger mechanisms for submarine landslides. For this study low-stress ring shear experiments have been carried out on a variety of sediments from &gt;50 gravity cores to characterise the velocity-dependent frictional behaviour. Mean values of the peak coefficient of friction vary from 0.46 for clay-dominated samples (53 % clay, 46 % silt, 1 %) sand up to 0.76 for coarse-grained sediments (26 % clay, 57 % silt, 17 % sand). The majority of the sediments tested show velocity strengthening regardless of the grain size distribution. For clayey sediments the peak and residual cohesive strength increases with increasing normal stress, with values from 1.3 to 10.6 kPa and up to 25 % of all strength supported by cohesive forces in the shallowmost samples. A pseudo-static slope stability analysis reveals that the different lithologies (even clay-rich material with clay content &gt;=50 %) tested are stable up to slope angles &lt;26&#176; under quasi-drained conditions.</md:MetaData/md:abstract><md:MetaData/md:project/md:label>MARUM</md:MetaData/md:project/md:label><md:MetaData/md:event/md:label /><md:MetaData/md:event/md:comment /><md:MetaData/md:license/md:label /><md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent>Location | Density, dry bulk | DBD | overburden stress | Vertical stress | SigmaV | Lithology/composition/facies | Lithology | Indicators for progressive deformation | Comment | Size fraction &lt; 0.002 mm, &gt; 9 phi, clay | &lt;2 &#181;m, &gt;9 phi | Size fraction &gt; 0.006 mm, silt | &gt;6 &#181;m | Size fraction 0.125-0.063 mm, 3.0-4.0 phi, very fine sand | 125-63 &#181;m | Size fraction 0.250-0.125 mm, 2.0-3.0 phi, fine sand | 250-125 &#181;m | Size fraction 0.500-0.250 mm, 1.0-2.0 phi, medium sand | 500-250 &#181;m | Size fraction 2.000-0.630 mm, coarse sand | 2000-630 &#181;m gS | Size fraction 2.000-1.000 mm, (-1.0)-0.0 phi, very coarse sand | 2-1 mm | fine-grained sand fraction | Sand | 27, Coeff. of Peak Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | Friction coefficient | &#181; | 51, Coeff. of Peak Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 100, Coeff. of Peak Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 198, Coeff. of Peak Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 27, Coeff. of Residual Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 51, Coeff. of Residual Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 100, Coeff. of Residual Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 198, Coeff. of Residual Friction related to various normal stress states given in [kPa] | 27, related to various normal stress states | Cohesive friction | Friction coh | 51, related to various normal stress states | 100, related to various normal stress states | 198, related to various normal stress states | 0,06 - 0,6, Rate-depending | Shear behaviour | Shear beh | 0,6 - 6,0, Rate-depending | 6,0 - 0,03, Rate-depending | 27, Peak shear strength 0.06 mm/min | Shear strength | &#181;peak | 51, Peak shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 100, Peak shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 198, Peak shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 27, Residual shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 51, Residual shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 100, Residual shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 198, Residual shear strength 0.06 mm/min | 27, of residual strength | Cohesion | C | 51, of residual strength | 100, of residual strength | 198, of residual strength</md:MetaData/md:additionalSearchableContent><md:MetaData/md:reference/md:title /><date>2015-07-17T08:07:47</date></data>
