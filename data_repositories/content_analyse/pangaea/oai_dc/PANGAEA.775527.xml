Relationship between mineral and geochemical specialization is established. A conclusion is made that ferromanganese mineralization is a permanent genetic series of matter supply: from endogenic (hydrothermal solution is a dominant source at deposition of chemical elements from mixture seawater plus hydrothermal solutions) to hydrogenic (seawater is a dominant source at element deposition). This results in geochemical and mineralogical variety of ferromanganese mineralization within this part of the Pacific Ocean.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, Dredge, DRG, N17-117, N17-122, N17-29, N17-31, N17-50, N17-54, N17-61, N17-88, Southwest Pacific</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1995-02-07</date></data>
