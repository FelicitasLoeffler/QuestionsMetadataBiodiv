Present outcrops of Mesozoic to Precambrian basement at the coast intruded by Mesozoic magmas within only 65 km of the Middle America Trench axis indicate truncation of the continental margin, tectonic removal of an accretionary zone, and consumption of ocean sediments and crust by subduction.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>66-486, 66-487, 66-488, 66-489, 66-489A, 66-490, 66-491, 66-492, 66-493, 66-493A, Apatite, Barite, Calcite, Carbonates, Chlorite, Chlorite+Kaolinite, Clay minerals, Clinoptilolite, Comment, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Dolomite, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Elevation of event, Event label, Feldspar, Glomar Challenger, Hornblende, Illite, Kaolinite, Latitude of event, Leg66, Longitude of event, Magnesium-Calcite, Mixed layer clay minerals, North Pacific, North Pacific/CREST, North Pacific/SLOPE, North Pacific/TRANSITION ZONE, North Pacific/TRENCH, ODP sample designation, Palygorskite, Phillipsite, Pyrite, FeS2, Pyroxene, Quartz, Rhodochrosite (2.84 &#197;), Sample code/label, Sample ID, Sepiolite, Siderite, Smectite, Talc, X-ray diffraction (XRD)</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1982-08-09</date></data>
