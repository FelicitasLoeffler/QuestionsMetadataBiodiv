Rock-Eval analysis, carbon isotope data, and lipid biomarkers show organic matter to contain varying proportions of marine and continental materials. In Hauterivian-Barremian organic-carbon-rich marlstone turbidites, large amounts of land-derived organic matter are found. Aptian-Albian black-colored shales are interspersed within green claystones, from which they differ by containing more marine organic matter. An abbreviated layer of black shale from the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary is dominated by well-preserved marine organic matter. Downslope transport and rapid reburial within a predominantly oxygenated deep-water setting created most of these examples of black shales, except for the Cenomanian-Turonian deposits in which deep-water anoxia may have been involved.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>103-637A, 103-638B, 103-638C, 103-639A, 103-639C, 103-640A, 103-641A, 103-641C, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg103, North Atlantic Ocean, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1988-08-04</date></data>
