The deviation of d18O records and Mg/Ca temperature estimates from thermocline-dwelling planktonic foraminifers suggests that local changes in salinity exerted a much stronger control on Pliocene TEP upper ocean water mass signatures than previously assumed. The most pronounced Pliocene change in TEP upper ocean stratification was the shoaling of the thermocline from ~4.8 to 4.0 Ma that was possibly triggered by changes in the configuration of low-latitude ocean gateways. During this time interval, mixed-layer temperatures and salinities remained relatively constant in contrast to a pronounced temperature (~6&#176;C) and salinity decrease at the bottom of the photic zone. This change led to a new state in the thermal structure of the TEP, as the thermocline remained relatively shallow until ~2.1 Ma.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>202-1241, 202-1241A, 202-1241B, 202-1241C, COMPCORE, Composite Core, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg202, North Pacific Ocean, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2006-01-18</date></data>
