We incubated the samples at in situ temperature (1.0&#176;C) for 12 hours with either 14** CH4 (dissolved in water, 2.5 kBq) or carrier-free 35** SO4 (dissolved in water, 50 kBq). Sediment was fixed in 25 ml 2.5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution or 20 ml 20% ZnAc solution for AOM or SR, respectively. Turnover rates were measured as previously described (http://edoc.mpg.de/177065, doi:10.4319/lom.2004.2.171).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>DEPTH, sediment/rock, ESONET, European Seafloor Observatory Network, H&#229;kon Mosby Mud Volcano, HERMIONE, Hotspot Ecosystem Research and Mans Impact On European Seas, LOOME, Maria S.
