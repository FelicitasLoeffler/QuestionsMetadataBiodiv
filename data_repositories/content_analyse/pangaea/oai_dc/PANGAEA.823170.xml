Levels of all components are lowest in the highly fractured sediments of Sites 440 and 434. A number of alkenes, furans, and sulfur compounds were detected in concentrations higher than noted in any other DSDP sediments examined to date. The types, amounts, and specificity of occurrence are similar to those for 1-meter gravity cores we have examined which bear a significant biological imprint. Site 436 shows high levels of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons, as well as olefins, including traces of dimethycyclopentanes and the highest level of cyclohexene detected in any DSDP sediment we have examined to date. The results from Site 436 were unexpected, considering the low organic-carbon content, absence of biogenic methane, and evidence of an aerobic depositional environment at this site.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>56-434, 56-434B, 56-435, 56-436, 57-438, 57-438A, 57-438B, 57-439, 57-440, 57-440A, 57-440B, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg56, Leg57, North Pacific/BASIN, North Pacific/RIDGE, North Pacific/TRENCH</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1980-11-22</date></data>
