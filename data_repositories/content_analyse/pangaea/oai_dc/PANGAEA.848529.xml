Samples of three potential food sources: eelgrass, epiphytes and seston, as well as consumer species were collected biweekly from March through September 2011. Temporal variation of stable isotope signatures was observed in primary producers and consumer species. However, variation within a species, particularly omnivores, often exceeded variation over time. The high degree of omnivory among the generalist feeders in this eelgrass community allows for generalist feeders to flexibly switch food sources, thus enhancing food web stability. As coastal systems are subject to seasonal changes, as well as alterations related to human disturbance and climate, these food webs may retain a certain resilience due to their plentiful omnivores.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biological sample, BIOS, Carbon/Nitrogen ratio, Carbon mass, DATE/TIME, DEPTH, water, Kiel_fjord_Z.marina-meadow, Kiel Fjord, Nitrogen mass, Number of individuals, Salinity, Sample mass, Sample type, Size, Species, Sulfur mass, Temperature, water, &#948;13C, &#948;15N, &#948;34S</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-08-05</date></data>
