The younger of these horizons lies at the base of a deep-sea ooze sequence and is of early or middle Miocene age. Glauconite formed in situ during periods of nondeposition related to strong bottom-water currents, in water depths of as much as 2500 m - five times greater than previously accepted limits for glauconite formation. The older horizon, of early Eocene age, is a record of the major transgression coincident with the separation of Rockall and Greenland.Isotopic age dating of the Miocene glauconites gives results in relatively close accord with their biostratigraphic age. However, an Eocene (NP12) glauconite gives a highly discrepant date (36.5 m.y. ago). One possible explanation is that the Eocene glauconites have continued to evolve after burial by the diagenetic uptake of potassium from the surrounding mud matrix, a possibility denied to the Miocene glauconites by the relative scarcity of available potassium in the nannofossil-foraminiferal ooze matrix.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Deep Sea Drilling Project, DSDP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1984-02-05</date></data>
