Accordingly, a detailed preparation of monitoring campaigns should include an accuracy check for the sampling configuration to prove the reliability of the monitoring results and the subsequent data processing. The accuracy of substance flow analyses is expected to be particularly weak for substances having high short-term variations of concentrations in sewage. This is especially the case linked to the observation of substance flows close to source in waste water systems. The verification of a monitoring configuration in a hospital sewer in Luxembourg is in the centre of interest of the case study presented here. A tracer test in the sewer system under observation is an essential element of the suggested accuracy check and provides valuable information for an uncertainty analysis. The results illustrate the importance of accuracy checks as an essential element of the preparation of monitoring campaigns. Moreover the study shows that continuous flow proportional sampling enables a representative observation of short-term peak loads of the iodinated x-ray contrast media iobitridol close to source.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2016-02-27</date></data>
