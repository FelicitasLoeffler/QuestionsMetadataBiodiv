As a result, new details of the history of the Philippine and Japan Seas suggest that the active marginal complex has a variety of "states" (stages). These states differ in terms of (1) the number of associated "echelons" (i.e. parts of the complex), each consisting of a subduction zone, island arc and back-arc basin situated one behind the other, and (2) their orientations. Changes in state are caused by blocking, i.e. hindering, the subduction. Continental as well as oceanic lithosphere is involved in the system. The "island arc" lithosphere, which is more simatic than continental lithosphere and more sialic than oceanic lithosphere, is a final product of the development of the marginal complex irrespective of whether the parent was continental or oceanic lithosphere.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>31-291, 31-291A, 31-299, 31-301, 56-436, 59-447A, 59-449, 59-450, 60-453, 60-459B, 60-460, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg31, Leg56, Leg59, Leg60, North Pacific/BASIN, North Pacific/Japan Sea, North Pacific/Japan Sea/CONT RISE, North Pacific/Philippine Sea/BASIN, North Pacific/Philippine Sea/TRENCH, North Pacific/RIDGE, North Pacific/SEDIMENT POND</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1991-05-10</date></data>
