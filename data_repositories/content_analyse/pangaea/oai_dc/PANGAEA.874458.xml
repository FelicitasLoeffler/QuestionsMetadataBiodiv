The analysis demonstrates that before the construction of the city, the area was mainly covered by deciduous oak woodland, although evergreen woody taxa were also present. The cultivation of the area in classical Hellenistic times resulted in a distinct increase in evergreen taxa. Later pine spread further and there was a regeneration of the deciduous oak woodland. On the other hand, the pollen diagram shows interesting aspects of the history of the harbour. The location was initially part of a lagoon with a marine environment. When the harbour was in use, the waters of the River Acheloos had a major impact on it. After the dissolution of the city of Oiniadai first a freshwater lake developed in the harbour and then a swamp, which finally silted up.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-04-11</date></data>
