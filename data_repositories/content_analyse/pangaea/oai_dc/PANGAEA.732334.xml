ETS activities were used to compute respiratory oxygen consuption, carbon oxidation, and nitrate reduction rates. Activities were correlated with depth of the water column, and their longshore distribution resembled that of euphotic zone phytoplankton productivity. Protein concentrations were closely correlated with ETS activities. Carbon biomass was calculated from protein and compared with other computed values. The carbon oxidation rate accounted for 13 % of the region's primary production.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ADEPD, Atlantic Data Base for Exchange Processes at the Deep Sea Floor, BC, Box corer, Cape Blanc, CapeBlanc_176, CapeBlanc_DCSN, CapeBlanc_E, CapeBlanc_F, CapeBlanc_H, CapeBlanc_L, CapeBlanc_M, CapeBlanc_N, CapeBlanc_O, CapeBlanc_P, van Veen Grab, VGRAB</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1977-01-19</date></data>
