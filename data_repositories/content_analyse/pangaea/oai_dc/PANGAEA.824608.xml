A suite of positive d18Obf excursions at intermediate depths of the Bering Sea, which seem at least in part associated with increases in the d18Obf gradients between the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, suggest the Bering Sea as a proximate source of intermediate water during several severe stadial episodes in the last glacial and deglacial period. Absence of such d18Obf gradients during periods of high surface productivity in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, which we correlate to D-O interstadials, suggests a reduction in intermediate water production in the Bering Sea and subsequent introduction of nutrient-rich deep waters from the North Pacific into intermediate depths of the Bering Sea. We argue that a reorganization of atmospheric circulation in the high-latitude North Pacific during severe cold episodes in the last glacial and deglacial period created favorable conditions for brine rejection in the northeastern Bering Sea. The resulting salinity increase in the cold surface waters could have initiated intermediate (and deep) water formation that spread out to the North Pacific.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bering Sea, Mirai, MR06-04_PC23A, MR06-04_XCO2s_r01, PC, PC23A, Piston corer</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2012-12-16</date></data>
