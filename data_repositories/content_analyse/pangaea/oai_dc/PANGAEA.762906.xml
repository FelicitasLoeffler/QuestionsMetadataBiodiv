An assumption that the low-temperature component, which is removed between 100&#176;C and 200&#176;C, is the secondary magnetization acquired in Brunhes normal chron, gives a core orientation. The oriented high-temperature component directions were tightly clustered around a pair of antipodal directions. The change of declination of the high-temperature component shows that the Celebes Sea was rotated counterclockwise about 60&#176; during Eocene and Oligocene time.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>124-770B, 124-770C, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Difference, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Event label, Joides Resolution, Leg124, Mindanao Sea, NRM, Declination after demagnetisation, NRM, Inclination after demagnetisation, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, Sample code/label, Sample comment</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1991-07-12</date></data>
