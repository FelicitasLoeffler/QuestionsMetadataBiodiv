(2001) and Uitz et al. (2006) modified as in Hirata et al. (2011) and Brewin et al. (2015) of in situ HPLC phytoplankton pigment data compiled from several databases and individual cruises. The weights used in the analysis were revised in accordance to this enlarged in situ pigment data set. The in situ database includes databases French campaigns (Atalante-3, KEOPS and Bonus Good Hope) and German research vessels (RV) Maria S. Merian, Meteor, Polarstern, Poseidon and Sonne. Cruises with RV Polarstern to the Southern hemisphere are labeled as ANT, to the Northern hemisphere as ARK, with RV Poseidon as POS, with RV Maria S. Merian with MSM, with RV Meteor as M and with RV Sonne as SO. A campaign in Indonesian waters was conducted from a small fisher boat.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AC3, Arctic Amplification, Chlorophyll a, Diatoms, Chlorophyll a, Haptophyta, Chlorophyll a, Prokaryotes, Chlorophyll a, total, DATE/TIME, DEPTH, water, FRAM, FRontiers in Arctic marine Monitoring, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, ORDINAL NUMBER, Reference/source</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-06-01</date></data>
