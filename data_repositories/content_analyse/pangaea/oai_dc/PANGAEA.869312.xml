Abyssal plain sediments are divided into two major units: (1) a lower, acoustically transparent layer of relatively uniform thickness draped over basaltic basement and (2) a horizontally layered sequence of highly variable thickness filling low areas on the surface of the transparent layer. The transparent layer, ranging in age from Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous, consists chiefly of dark gray, siliceous clays and claystones with minor zeolitic clay and nannofossil ooze. Sedimentation rates are between 5 and 30 m/m.y. being highest in the Lower Cretaceous. Upper Cretaceous sediment are sparse or absent. The relatively high sedimentation rates for pelagic clay are probably due to the proximity of the Australian continent. The layered unit consists of calcareous oozes and lesser zeolitic clay and radiolarian ooze, all of Cenozoic age. Many of the oozes contain shallow-water foraminifers and graded sequences suggesting deposition by mass transport.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>27-259, 27-261, 27-263, Comment, Deep Sea Drilling Project, Deposit type, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Event label, Glomar Challenger, Identification, Indian Ocean//PLAIN, Leg27, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Position, Quantity of deposit, Sample code/label, Sediment type, Size, Substrate type, Visual description</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1974-12-09</date></data>
