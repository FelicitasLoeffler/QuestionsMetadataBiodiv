The warm phases are separated one from another by stadial phases with, at least in one case, indications of periglacial solifluction. This sequence belongs to the Brunhes magnetic epoch. The pollen data allow to exclude an Eemian or Holsteinian age of the warm period sediments. Thus a Cromerian age is assumed, though the exact position of the newly described warm periods within the ''Cromerian'' remains uncertain.A section in a borehole at Akazienweg is of Holsteinian age.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Akazienweg, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, G&#246;ttingen, Lower Saxony, Germany, HAND, Lower Saxony, Northern Germany, Ottostrasse, Sampling by hand, Wallensen</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1994-11-08</date></data>
