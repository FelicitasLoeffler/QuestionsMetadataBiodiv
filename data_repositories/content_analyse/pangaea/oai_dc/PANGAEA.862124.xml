LAPMv2 has a graphical user interface that guides the user through the different steps of the mosaicking workflow.LAPMv2 runs on 64-bit Windows, MacOS X and Linux operating systems. There are two versions for each operating system: (1) the WEB-installers (lightweight but require an internet connection during the installation) and (2) the MCR installers (large files but can be installed on computer without internet-connection). The user manual explains how to install and start the program on the different operating systems.
