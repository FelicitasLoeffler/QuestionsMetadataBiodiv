Two sites were organized: one at fumarolic field with sensors (iButton DL1922) on the surface at 0.05 cm depth and at 0.4 m depth, second at the rock nearby to represent natural conditions without volcanic influence with air (2 m height) and surface (0.05 m depth) sensors (Hobo U12-008 with TMC-HD sensors). Dataset covers July 2013 - July 2015, with some gaps due to air sensor damage. The MAST temperature out of fumarolic field is close to -16&#176;C, and one at fumarolic field is close to 25&#176;C.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-11-27</date></data>
