We have mapped forest management, a land use, in the southeastern and northwestern United States, 1.5 million square kilometers, at high spatial. This is a novel study using spectral time series analysis, expert derived training data and a random forest classifier to map forest management, calculate probability and uncertainty of class membership.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>File content, File format, File name, File size, Uniform resource locator/link to file, United States of America, USA_cont</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-09-04</date></data>
