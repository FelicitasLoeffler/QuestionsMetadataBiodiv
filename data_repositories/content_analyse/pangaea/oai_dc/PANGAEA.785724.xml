Uncertainties associated with radiometric dating preclude a clear chronological assessment of the environmental consequences of CFB volcanism. Our results document a 25% decline in the marine 187Os/188Os record that predates the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (KTB) and coincides with late Maastrichtian warming. We argue that this decline provides a chemostratigraphic marker of Deccan volcanism and thus constitutes compelling evidence that the main environmental consequence of Deccan volcanism was a transient global warming event of 3&#176; to 5&#176;C that is fully resolved from the KTB mass extinction.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>25-245, 74-525A, 86-577_Site, AGE, COMPCORE, Composite Core, Deep Sea Drilling Project, Depth, relative, DEPTH, sediment/rock, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Event label, Glomar Challenger, Indian Ocean//BASIN, Leg25, Leg74, Leg86, Negative-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (N-TIMS), North Pacific, ODP sample designation, Osmium, Osmium 187/Osmium 188, error, Osmium 187/Osmium 188 ratio, Sample code/label, South Atlantic/CREST</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2003-07-09</date></data>
