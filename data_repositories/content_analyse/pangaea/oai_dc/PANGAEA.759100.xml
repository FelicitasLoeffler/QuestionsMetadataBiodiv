Biomass of mesoplankton in the upper 200 m layer ranges from 3.1 to 8.6 g/m**2, but sometimes it increases up to as much as 98 g/m**2 in local population explosions of salps. Jellies predominate in macroplankton at depths of up to 2-3 km, contributing 97-98% of live weight and 30-70% of biomass as organic carbon. In importance they are followed by micronecton fishes (up to 40% of organic carbon). Contributions of other groups countable from the submersible were negligible. Distributions of species at particular stations are discussed.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, AMK20, AMK20-2332, AMK20-2333, AMK20-2339, AMK20-2342, AMK20-2344, AMK20-2345, AMK20-2346, Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, DM38, DM38-3450, DM38-3451, DM38-3452, DM38-3453, DM38-3535, DM38-3536, DM38-3537, DM38-3538, Dmitry Mendeleev, MULT, Multiple investigations, North Tropical Pacific, Pacific Ocean</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1992-04-07</date></data>
