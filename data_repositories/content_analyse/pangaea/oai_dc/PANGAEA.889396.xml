The simulations relies on the coupled physcial-biogeochemical HYCOM-ECOSMO and has been forced by a Global High Resolution Climate Reconstruction (ECHAM6). The dataset is monthly, it consist of temperature, salinity, currents, oxygen, nitrate, phosphate and silicate all interpolated to 1 meter above the sea floor. Additionally the dataset contains gross primary and secondary production integrated over the water column.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Deep-sea Sponge Grounds Ecosystems of the North Atlantic, File content, File format, File name, File size, NorthAtlantic, SponGES, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-04-27</date></data>
