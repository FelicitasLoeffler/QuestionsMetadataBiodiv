In this context, it is increasingly important to understand the biochemical responses of cells to environmental cues at the whole system level, an aim that is being brought closer by advances in high throughput, cost-efficient plant metabolomics. To support molecular breeding activities, we have assessed the economic, technical and statistical feasibility of using direct mass spectrometry methods to evaluate the physiological state of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown under different stress conditions.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>CIMMYT, El-Batan, Event label, File content, File name, HAND, Mexico, Sampling by hand, Tlaltizapan, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2012-02-16</date></data>
