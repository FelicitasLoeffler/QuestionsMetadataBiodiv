Characteristic trace metal enrichment in organic-rich layers was observed, with organic-rich sapropel layers ranging in Hg concentration from 314 to 488 ng/g (avg = 385), with an average enrichment in Hg by a factor of 5.9 compared to organic-poor background sediments, which range from 39 to 94 ng/g Hg (avg = 66). Comparison of seawater concentrations and sapropel accumulations of trace metals suggests that organic matter quantitatively delivers Hg to the seafloor. Near complete scavenging of Hg from the water column renders the sapropel Hg isotopic composition representative of mid-Pleistocene Mediterranean seawater. Sapropels have an average d202Hg value of -0.91 per mil &#177; 0.15 per mil (n = 5, 1 SD) and D199Hg value of 0.11 per mil &#177; 0.03 per mil (n = 5, 1 SD). Background sediments have an average d202Hg of -0.76 per mil &#177; 0.16 per mil (n = 5, 1 SD) and D199Hg of 0.05 per mil &#177; 0.01 per mil (n = 5, 1 SD), which is indistinguishable from the sapropel values. We suggest that the sapropel isotopic composition is most representative of the mid-Pleistocene Tyrrhenian Sea.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>161-974C, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg161, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, Tirreno Sea</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2009-05-31</date></data>
