The nodules are comparable to oceanic nodules in composition, but have some significant differences, including a more rapid rate of growth. Sedimentary-diagenetic processes are mainly responsible for their formation, but there is reason to believe hydrothermal fluids play some role.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Lake Baikal, Russia, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Uskhan_Baikal_B</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1993-12-09</date></data>
