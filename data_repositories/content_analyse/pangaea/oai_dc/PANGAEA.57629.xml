Dated events in comparable marine core has enabled the reduction of accumulation rate during the last ice age to be estimated. Climatic events recorded in the ice core indicate that the warmest Holocene period in the Southern Hemisphere occurred at an earlier date than in the Northern Hemisphere.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AGE, Age, maximum/old, Age, minimum/young, Calculated, Depth, bottom/max, DEPTH, ice/snow, Depth, top/min, Deuterium excess, DomeC, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, &#948;18O, water, &#948; Deuterium</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1979-03-15</date></data>
