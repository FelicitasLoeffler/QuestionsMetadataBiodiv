The author analysed an interesting specimen of black manganese-ore which had a fractured surface which looked like that of a broken piece of wood. This new manganese mineral was studied in its form, physical properties and chemical composition. The author later named this mineral form as "todorokite".</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aluminium oxide, Barium oxide, Calcium oxide, Deposit type, Description, Insoluble residue, Iron oxide, Fe2O3, Japan, Loss on ignition, Magnesium oxide, Manganese oxide, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Oxygen, Phosphorus oxide, Potassium oxide, Sample ID, Silicon dioxide, Sodium oxide, Sulfur trioxide, Todoroki_Y, Water in rock, Wet chemistry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1934-10-19</date></data>
