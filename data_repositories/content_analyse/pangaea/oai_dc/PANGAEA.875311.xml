The buoy was deployed during the Norwegian Young sea ICE cruise (N-ICE 2015) project. The time series describes the position and additional parameters of the buoy between 17 Feb 2015 and 15 Mar 2015 in sample intervals of 1 hour. The data set has been processed, including the removal of obvious inconsistencies (missing values).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>2015C4, Arctic Ocean, AWI_SeaIce, Buoy, BUOY, DATE/TIME, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, Pressure, atmospheric, Sea Ice Physics @ AWI, Temperature, water</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-05-17</date></data>
