Tara Oceans Data are particularly suited to study the genetic, morphological and functional diversity of plankton. The present data publication contains measurements from the Continuous Surface Sampling System [CSSS] made during one campaign of the Tara Oceans Expedition. Water was pumped at the front of the vessel from ~2m depth, then de-bubbled and circulated to a Sea-Bird TSG temperature and conductivity sensor. System maintenance (instrument cleaning, flushing) was done approximately once a week and in port between successive legs. All data were stamped with a GPS.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>[CSSS], [day/night] [surface water layer (ENVO:00002042)], Algiers to Barcelona, Stations: TARA_008-011, Basis of event, Campaign of event, Comment of event, Continuous Surface Sampling System, DATE/TIME, DEPTH, water, Device of event, Event label, Fondation Tara Expeditions, FondTara, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, Optional event label, Salinity, Station label, SV Tara, TARA_20090926Z, TARA_20090926Z_UDW_EVENT_CSSS, Tara Oceans Expedition, Temperature, water, TOE-2009-2013, URI of event</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-10-21</date></data>
