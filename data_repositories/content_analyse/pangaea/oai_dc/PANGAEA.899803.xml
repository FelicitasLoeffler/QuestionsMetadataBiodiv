The measurements were taken during the PASCAL (Physical feedbacks of Arctic planetary boundary level Sea ice, Cloud and AerosoL) campaign at around 81.8&#176;N, 10&#176;E. BELUGA consists of a 90m3 helium filled balloon with modular instrumentation: An ultrasonic anemometer package, a hot-wire anemometer package for turbulence measurements and a broadband radiation package with upward and downward looking pyranometers and pyrgeometers. Instrument characteristics and more details about the BELUGA system can be found in Egerer et al. (2019). In most of the 16 flights, radiation and turbulence packages were combined, with a vertical distance of around 25 m. Each flight consists of at least one continuous profile up to typically 1000 m altitude or 500 m in strong wind conditions.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AC3, Arctic Amplification</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-03-29</date></data>
