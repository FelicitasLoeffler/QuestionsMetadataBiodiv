Prominent cyst accumulation peaks representing extremely oligotrophic and stratified thermocline conditions mimic the Greenland ice core and northern Atlantic Dansgaard/Oeschger stadials and Heinrich events. We provide new evidence for a coupled tropical/high-latitude Atlantic climate system during the last glacial period and suggest that changes in the zonality of the low-latitude winds may play an important role in modulating rapid interhemispheric climate variability.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Gravity corer (Kiel type), M35/1, M35003-4, Meteor (1986), SFB261, SL, South Atlantic in Late Quaternary: Reconstruction of Budget and Currents</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2001-03-08</date></data>
