Since all measurements were performed by a high-resolution Continuous Flow Analysis system, for the first time seasonal signals of chemical trace species could be obtained from the interior of central Antarctica over a period of approximately 2 millennia. Although the elevation as well as the accumulation rate differ between the drilling sites, similar values were obtained by comparing mean concentrations spanning the last 900 years. However, a distinct lack of intersite correlation was found on decadal timescales. Despite a noticeable accumulation change, apparent in one core, no significant concentration change of all three species has occurred. All the measured ions show clear seasonal signals over the whole records. While the sea-salt-related component sodium peaks simultaneously with calcium, the maximum ammonium concentration occurs in the snow with a time lag of 2 months after the sea-salt peak. More than 60% of the calcium concentration can be attributed to an ocean source. Elevated sodium concentrations were found within this millennium compared to mean values of the whole records, but the spatially varying shape of the increase suggests that a possible climatic signal is biased by local deposition effects.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>B31, B32, B33, DML03C98_09, DML05C98_32, DML07C98_31, DML15C98_14, DML17C98_33, DML18C98_04, Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica, EPICA, EPICA_DML3, European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica, FB9804, FB9809, FB9814, ICEDRILL, Ice drill, Neumayer Station (WMO89002)</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2000-10-02</date></data>
