Virtually undisturbed sediment samples have been taken using a video-guided multiple corer (MUC) at 13 HAUSGARTEN stations along a bathymetric (1,000 - 4,000 m water depth) and a latitudinal transect in 2,500 m water depth as well as two stations at 230 and 1,200 m water depth within the framework of the KONGHAU project. Various biogenic sediment compounds were analyzed to estimate the input of organic matter from phytodetritus sedimentation, benthic activities (e.g. bacterial exoenzymatic activity), and the total biomass of the smallest sediment-inhabiting organisms (size range: bacteria to meiofauna).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ARK-XXIX/2.2, Carbon, organic, total, Chlorophyll a, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Esterase activity per sediment volume, FRAM, FRontiers in Arctic marine Monitoring, Hausgarten, Long-term Investigation at AWI-Hausgarten off Svalbard, Multicorer with television, North Greenland Sea, Phaeopigments, Phospholipids, Polarstern, Porosity, Protein, readily soluble per sediment volume, PS93/077-2, PS93.2, TVMUC</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-07-17</date></data>
