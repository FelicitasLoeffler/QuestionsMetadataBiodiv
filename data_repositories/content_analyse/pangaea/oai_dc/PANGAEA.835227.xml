Numerically, over 80% of the copepod community across the transect was less than 650 &#181;m in size, dominated by nauplii, and smaller copepods, while 80% of the biomass (as mg C/m**3) was larger than 1300 &#181;m in body length. Predation by the carnivorous copepod Corycaeus sp. was estimated to be able to remove up to 2% /d of the copepods &lt;1000 &#181;m in size. By the help of grazing models we estimated that primary producers were mainly grazed upon by ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (40-80% /d combined) in temperate waters but appendicularians became increasingly important in the tropical waters grazing about 40% of the biomass per day. Despite their high abundance and biomass, copepods contributed less than 20% of the grazing at most stations. Secondary production was low (carbon specific egg production &lt;0.14 /d) but typical for food limited oligotrophic oceans.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Chlorophyll a, areal concentration, Chlorophyll a, standard deviation, Copepoda, biomass as carbon, integrated, DATE/TIME, Depth, bottom/max, Depth, top/min, Event label, Galathea_3/7-1, Galathea_3/7-15, Galathea_3/7-18, Galathea_3/7-23, Galathea_3/7-28, Galathea_3/7-33, Galathea_3/7-8, Galathea 3, HDMS Vaedderen, Indian Ocean, International Polar Year (2007-2008), IPY, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, MULT, Multiple investigations, Protista, biomass as carbon, Standard deviation, Temperature, water, Temperature, water, standard deviation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2013-08-26</date></data>
