The committee was established in order to furnish an integrated data set from the Pliocene portion of Site 1165 as a contribution to the ongoing debate about Pliocene climate and climate evolution in Antarctica. The proxies determined in our various laboratories were the following: magnetostratigraphy and magnetic properties, grain-size distributions (granulometry), near-ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectrophotometry, calcium carbonate content, characteristics of foraminifer, diatom, and radiolarian content, clay mineral composition, and stable isotopes. In addition to the HiRISC samples, other data sets contained in this report are subsets of much larger data sets. We included these subsets in order to provide the reader with a convenient integrated data set of Pliocene-Pleistocene strata from the East Antarctic continental margin. The data are presented in the form of 14 graphs (in addition to the site map). Text and figure captions guide the reader to the original data sets. Some preliminary interpretations are given at the end of the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>188-1165, 188-1165B, COMPCORE, Composite Core, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Indian Ocean, Joides Resolution, Leg188, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2004-05-08</date></data>
