Although permafrost cannot be measured directly with remote sensing, many permafrost features are observable. Polarimetric information can be used in this context. Polarimetric data of TerraSAR-X is the basis for a local landcover classification presented here, which reflects different scattering mechanisms. The resulting classification aims on the identification of process areas and periglacial features such as thaw slumps (bare wet surfaces) and thaw lakes as well as wetland areas.The following regions are covered in the dataset: Barrow (Alaska), Mackenzie Delta (Canada), Kytalyk (Russia), Lena Delta (Russia), Vaskiny Dachi (Russia), Herschel Island (Canada).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>C01_Barrow, C04_Mackenzie_Delta, C06_Kytalyk, C07_Lena_Delta, C08_Vaskiny_Dachi, C11_Hershel_Island, DUE-GlobPermafrost, ESA Data User Element - GlobPermafrost, Event label, File content, File format, File name, File size, MON, Monitoring, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-01-24</date></data>
