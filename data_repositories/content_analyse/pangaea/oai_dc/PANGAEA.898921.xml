The bioavailability and environmental stability of these compounds make them potential threat to these organisms, specially the sessile organisms. We have examined the effects of atorvastatin, a globally prescribed drug, on the blue mussels &#8211; Mytilus edulis. In this data set, we presents the effect of atorvastatin (ATO) on mitochondrial respiration of Mytilus edulis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Atorvastatin, Buffer, Mitochondria, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial respiration, Mitochondrial suspension, Mytilus edulis, Osmolarity, Protein, Ratio, Salinity, Sample ID, Species, Temperature, water, Time in weeks, Tissue, wet mass, Tissues, Treatment</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-03-04</date></data>
