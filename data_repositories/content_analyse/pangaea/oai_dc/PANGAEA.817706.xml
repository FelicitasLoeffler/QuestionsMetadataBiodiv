DSDP Leg 66 drilling within the Middle America Trench complex provided a unique opportunity to investigate these interrelationships along a transect of eight drill sites beginning on the trench outer slope and traversing the trench, trench inner slope, and upper continental slope. Investigations of other convergent margins suggest that deformation occurs most rapidly along the lower trench inner slope and is reflected by the geotechnical properties (Carson, 1977, Seely, 1977, and von Huene, 1979). This study focuses on the geotechnical properties of Middle America Trench sediments and the possible affects of convergence on these properties.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>66-487, 66-488, 66-489, 66-489A, 66-490, 66-491, 66-492, 66-492A, 66-493, 66-493B, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg66, North Pacific, North Pacific/CREST, North Pacific/SLOPE, North Pacific/TRANSITION ZONE, North Pacific/TRENCH</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1982-08-06</date></data>
