Incident irradiances were recorded at 0.3 nm bandwidth using an upward-facing plane irradiance cosine corrector (180&#176; field of view) and 10 m fiber optic cable. The instrument was factory calibrated prior to deployment for absolute irradiance measurements from 210-850 nm. Irradiances were recorded at 1 min. intervals. These in situ daily doses may be compared to incident daily UV doses recorded as part of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Antarctic UV Monitoring Network, the NOAA dosage data are available at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/antuv/</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>DATE/TIME, DEPTH, water, Monitoring station, MONS, Palmer_station, Ultraviolet A radiation, dose daily, Ultraviolet B radiation, dose daily</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-08-14</date></data>
