The cartographic evaluation emphasized the terrain surrounding the snow and ice covered areas.Gurgler Ferner covers an area of 10.7 km**2 , 60 % of which are situated between 2800 and 3100 m, the altitude range of the equilibrium line. From 1969 to 1981 the glacier and its tributaries lost 25 *10**6 m**3 of water, equivalent to a mean lowering of the surface by 17 cm per year in good agreement with the value of Hintereisferner.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>GLAC, Gurgler_Ferner, Gurgler Ferner, &#214;tztaler Alpen, Austria, Sampling/measurements on glacier</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-08-16</date></data>
