Most intensively was the sea ice investigated in an area about 100 km northwest of Berkner Island, where a suitable site for the German station was found. In addition to the drift conditions, ice thickness as weIl as temperature and salinity of the ice were measured and the mechanical properties established. Several ice cores were taken back to Germany, where the compressive strength was measured in respect to strain rate, salinity, depth and temperature.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>DAE_1979/80, DAE79/80_13, DAE79/80_14, DAE79/80_15, DAE79/80_16, DAE79/80_17, DAE79/80_20, DAE79/80_21, DAE79/80_22, DAE79/80_24, DAE79/80_25, DAE79/80_26, DAE79/80_27, DAE79/80_31, DAE79/80_33, DAE79/80_36, DAE79/80_4, DAE79/80_40, DAE79/80_5, DAE79/80_8, DAE79/80_9, DAE79/80_AB, Deutsche-Antarktis-Expedition pre-site-survey 1979/80, ICE, Ice station, Polarsirkel, Weddell Sea, South/Filchner Ronne Ice Shelf</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1981-01-16</date></data>
