In Site 547 chloride concentrations increase to almost 80% of the halite saturation values. Gypsum occurrences in the sediments immediately overlying the halite deposit can be explained in terms of migration of Ca**2+ and SO2**2- from the underlying evaporites. At shallower depths sulfate concentrations decrease rapidly as a result of sulfate reduction processes. The same processes lead to the removal of calcium in the form of calcium carbonate. At Site 547, the chloride concentration depth profile suggests a maximum of dissolved chloride which may be the result of advective flow from nearby (abput 6 km) evaporite salt diapirs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Deep Sea Drilling Project, DSDP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1984-03-08</date></data>
