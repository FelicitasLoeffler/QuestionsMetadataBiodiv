Virtually undisturbed sediment samples have been taken using a video-guided multiple corer (MUC) at 13 HAUSGARTEN stations along a bathymetric (1,000 - 4,000 m water depth) and a latitudinal transect in 2,500 m water depth as well as two stations at 230 and 1,200 m water depth within the framework of the KONGHAU project. Various biogenic sediment compounds were analyzed to estimate the input of organic matter from phytodetritus sedimentation, benthic activities (e.g. bacterial exoenzymatic activity), and the total biomass of the smallest sediment-inhabiting organisms (size range: bacteria to meiofauna).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Chlorophyll a, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Esterase activity per sediment volume, Hausgarten, HAUSGARTEN 2013, HERMES, Hotspot Ecosystem Research on the Margins of European Seas, KH, Long-term Investigation at AWI-Hausgarten off Svalbard, Maria S.
