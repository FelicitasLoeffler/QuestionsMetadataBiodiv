SBT349, Nonomureae sp. SBT364, and Nocardiopsis sp. SBT366. The genomes of these actinomycetes were sequenced and the genomic potential for secondary metabolism was evaluated. Their draft genomes have sizes of 8.0, 10, and 5.8Mb having 687, 367, and 179 contigs with a GC content of 71.6, 70.7, and 72.7%, respectively. Moreover, antiSMASH 3.0 predicted 108, 149, and 75 secondary metabolite gene clusters, respectively which highlight the metabolic capacity of the three actinomycete species to produce diverse classes of natural products.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Accession number, Accession number, link, Area/locality, Date/Time of event, Depth, bottom/max, Depth, top/min, DIVER, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, Milos_052013, Sample code/label, Sampling by diver, Species code, Sponge Milos Collection</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2015-12-03</date></data>
