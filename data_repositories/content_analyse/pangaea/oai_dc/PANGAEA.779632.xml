One set of factors is for bulk sediment powders, and the other applies to oriented aggregates of clay-sized fractions (&lt;2 &#181;m). We analyzed mixtures of standard minerals with known weight percentages of each component and solved for the normalization factors using matrix singular value decomposition. The components in bulk powders include total clay minerals (a mixture of smectite, illite, and chlorite), quartz, plagioclase, and calcite. For clay-sized fractions, the minerals are smectite, illite, chlorite, and quartz. We tested the utility of the method by analyzing natural mudstone specimens from Site 297 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project, which is located in the Shikoku Basin south of Site 1177 of the Ocean Drilling Program (Ashizuri transect).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>190-1173A, 190-1174A, 190-1174B, 190-1175A, 190-1176A, 190-1177A, 190-1178A, 190-1178B, 31-297, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Joides Resolution, Leg190, Leg31, North Pacific/Philippine Sea/BASIN, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, Philippine Sea</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2003-04-20</date></data>
