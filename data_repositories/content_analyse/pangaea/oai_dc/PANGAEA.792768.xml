A most likely order of the more reliable ichthyolith events is compared with a synthesis of ichthyolith biostratigraphy in the North Pacific and with dated composite ranges. The resultant preliminary ichthyolith stratigraphy suggests that the Cenozoic is represented by the upper 20 m at Site 596 and 16 to 22 m at Site 595. Mixing of taxa precludes a clear recognition of the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary at Site 595. The occurrence of 13 newly described subtypes is recorded in Mesozoic sediments at Sites 595 and 596. These new subtypes and previously described Mesozoic forms may be useful for recognizing Mesozoic subdivisions when their occurrences in sequences dated by other microfossils are investigated.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Deep Sea Drilling Project, DSDP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1987-10-18</date></data>
