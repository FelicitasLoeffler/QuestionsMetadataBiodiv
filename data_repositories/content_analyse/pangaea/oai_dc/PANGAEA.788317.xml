In contrast, upper Miocene sediments from Site 604 (2364 m present water depth) show extensive reworking and downslope transport. At Site 612, benthic foraminifers show a succession from an upper Miocene Bolivina alata-Nonionella sp. biofacies, to an uppermost Miocene Bulimina alazanensis biofacies, to a lower Pliocene Cassidulina reflexa biofacies, to an upper Pliocene Melonis barleeanum-Islandiella laevigata biofacies. Evidence suggests that the Pliocene biofacies are in situ, although they could have been transported downslope from the upper-middle bathyal zone. At Site 613, Uvigerina peregrina dominated the "middle" Pliocene, while Globocassidulina subglobosa was dominant in the early and late Pliocene. High abundances of U. peregrina at Site 613 are associated with high values of sedimentary organic carbon.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Deep Sea Drilling Project, DSDP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1987-09-06</date></data>
