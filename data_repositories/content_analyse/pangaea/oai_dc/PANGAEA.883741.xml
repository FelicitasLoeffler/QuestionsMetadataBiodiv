While the recent surge in microbiome studies has brought about a paradigm shift by which individuals cannot truly be considered independently of the bacterial communities they host, the role of gut microbiota in organismal response to human-induced environmental change is still scarcely studied. Here, we applied a metabarcoding approach to examine the impact of urbanisation on the gut microbiota of Passer domesticus. We found urbanisation to be associated to lower microbiota species diversity, modifications in taxonomic composition and community structure, and changes in functional composition.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Belgium, BIO, Biology, NBelgium</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-12-04</date></data>
