Juvenile abalones were exposed to a temperature ramp (+3 &#176;C day&#8722;1) under hypoxia (50% air saturation) and hypercapnia (~1000 &#956;atm pCO2), both individually and in combination. Experiments are denoted as control (warming under normoxic normocapnia), hypoxia (warming under hypoxic normocapnia), hypercapnia (warming under normoxic hypercapnia, and combined (warming under hypoxic hypercapnia).The table is arranged to be used with the R package MCMC.qPCR (Matz et al., 2013).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-09-28</date></data>
