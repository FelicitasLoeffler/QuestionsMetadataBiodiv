These biostratigraphic refinements bear on the calculations of sedimentation rates and on the age-depth plots prepared for the Initial Reports volume for Leg 133. To make available the revised data to anyone who may wish to make use of it, the revised biostratigraphic information is presented here in tabulated form. Revised age-depth plots also are presented for all of the sites  to facilitate comparison of sedimentation rate curves and to identify intervals where significant changes have been made based on post-cruise studies. The revised age-depth plots include calcareous nannofossils only, and the revised data have been taken from thechapters contributed for this volume (Gartner et al., 1993, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.sr.133.213.1993, Wei and Gartner, 1993, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.sr.133.216.1993). Planktonic foraminifer biostratigraphy revisions became available subsequently and could not be readily incorporated. The age-depth plots for Sites 812 through 818 were made with the (ADP) program provided to ODP by Dave Lazarus.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1993-08-13</date></data>
