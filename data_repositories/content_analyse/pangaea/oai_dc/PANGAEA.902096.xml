These files contain clwvi as a function of measurement time, elevation and azimuth angle observing direction. clwvi is based on multi-variate regression retrievals (see also Crewell and L&#246;hnert, 2003, doi:10.1029/2002RS002654). Provided uncertainties describe the expected standard error of clwvi. Note, that clwvi values are given for all available times so that it is up to the user to decide whether or not to use the values if quality flags are set. Additionally included are temperature, pressure and humidity at the instrument location as well quality flags characterizing the instrument and retrieval performance.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AC3, Arctic Amplification, AWI_stations, AWIPEV, clouds, DATE/TIME, File format, File name, File size, Koldewey, liquid water path, microwave radiometer, Research station, RS, Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-05-27</date></data>
