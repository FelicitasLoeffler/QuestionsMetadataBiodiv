The permafrost areas surrounding the Lena are predicted to thaw at increasing rates due to global temperature increases. With this thawing, large amounts of carbon &#8211; either organic or in the gaseous forms carbon dioxide and methane &#8211; will reach the waters of the Lena and the adjacent Buor-Khaya Bay (Laptev Sea). Methane concentrations and the isotopic signal of methane in the waters of the Lena Delta and estuary were monitored from 2008 to 2010. Creeks draining from permafrost soils produced hotspots for methane input into the river system (median concentration 1500 nM) compared with concentrations of 30&#8211;85 nM observed in the main channels of the Lena. No microbial methane oxidation could be detected, thus diffusion is the main process of methane removal. We estimated that the riverine diffusive methane flux is 3&#8211;10 times higher than the flux from surrounding terrestrial environment. To maintain the observed methane concentrations in the river, additional methane sources are necessary. The methane-rich creeks could be responsible for this input.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AWI_Coast, Coastal Ecology @ AWI</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2013-07-30</date></data>
