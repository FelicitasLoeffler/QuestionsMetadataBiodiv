The new local shoreline displacement curve is compared and discussed with the previous curve of Vorpommern (Southern Baltic Sea).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Age, 14C AMS, Age, dated, Age, dated standard deviation, ELEVATION, RuegenSchaabe, R&#252;gen, Sample code/label, Sample comment, Sample ID, Sediment type</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1997-07-04</date></data>
