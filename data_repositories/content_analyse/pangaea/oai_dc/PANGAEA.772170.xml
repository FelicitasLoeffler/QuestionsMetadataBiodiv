These pigments are present in depositional areas receiving high inputs of terrestrially derived oxidized organic matter. Such areas include the Black Sea, the Bay of Biscay, the Blake-Bahama Basin, and slumped Miocene deposits off Cape Bojador on the west coast of Africa.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>38-341, 42-380A, 42-381, 43-386, 43-387, 44-391A, 44-391C, 47-397, 47-397A, 47-398D, Black Sea, Chlorins, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Event label, Glomar Challenger, Leg38, Leg42, Leg43, Leg44, Leg47, North Atlantic/BASIN, North Atlantic/CONT RISE, North Atlantic/Norwegian Sea, North Atlantic/SEAMOUNT, Porphyrins, Sample code/label</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1978-12-05</date></data>
