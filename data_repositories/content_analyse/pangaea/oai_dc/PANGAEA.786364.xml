Although the sites were primarily targeted to reconstruct the stratigraphy and paleoceanography of the region (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.ir.181.101.2000), they are particularly interesting from a geochemical perspective because, as clearly evidenced by shipboard pore water and gas analyses, recovered sediment cores span an exceptional range of chemical environments. Pore water alkalinity, NH4+, SO4**2-, and PO4**3- concentrations, as well as headspace CH4 concentrations, indicate significant differences in sediment redox conditions across the region (Shipboard Scientific Party, 1999, doi:10.2973/odp.proc.ir.181.101.2000). The distribution of solid and dissolved manganese plays an important role in geochemical interpretations of such sedimentary environments (e.g., Froelich et al., 1979, doi:10.1016/0016-7037(79)90095-4, Thamdrup and Dalsgaard, 2000, doi:10.1016/S0016-7037(00)00496-8). Dissolved Mn2+ concentrations of pore waters at four sites (1119, 1122, 1123, and 1125) drilled during Leg 181 are presented in this report.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>181-1119B, 181-1122A, 181-1122C, 181-1123A, 181-1123B, 181-1123C, 181-1125A, 181-1125B, Depth, composite, DEPTH, sediment/rock, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Elevation of event, Event label, ICP-MS, Inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry, Joides Resolution, Latitude of event, Leg181, Longitude of event, Manganese, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, ODP sample designation, Sample code/label, South Pacific Ocean</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2002-07-18</date></data>
