Cod spawning is most likely to occur in the Motovsky Bay when large cod forage in southeastern waters, and prespawning fish migrate close by the Murmansk coast. Under such conditions cod spawn in the Motovsky Bay, but low water temperature and slow egg drift toward Murmansk coastal waters delay development of cod eggs. As a result the eggs remain at the first stage for a long time, this causes high egg mortality before hatching. Larvae that survive and become pelagic and then bottom juveniles nevertheless have little chance to survive in winter because they are not biologically ready for overwintering. Thus, delay in egg development at the first stage delays subsequent stages of fish ontogeny, and strongly impairs survival of cod juveniles from the Motovsky Bay.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, Net, NET, Pon-96a-T1-1, Pon-96a-T1-10, Pon-96a-T1-11, Pon-96a-T1-12, Pon-96a-T1-13, Pon-96a-T1-14, Pon-96a-T1-15, Pon-96a-T1-16, Pon-96a-T1-17, Pon-96a-T1-18, Pon-96a-T1-19, Pon-96a-T1-2, Pon-96a-T1-20, Pon-96a-T1-21, Pon-96a-T1-22, Pon-96a-T1-3, Pon-96a-T1-4, Pon-96a-T1-5, Pon-96a-T1-6, Pon-96a-T1-7, Pon-96a-T1-8, Pon-96a-T1-9, Pon-96a-T2-1, Pon-96a-T2-2, Pon-96a-T2-3, Pon-96a-T2-4, Pon-96a-T2-5, Pon-96a-T2-6, Pon-96a-T2-7, Pon-96a-T2-8</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1996-04-28</date></data>
