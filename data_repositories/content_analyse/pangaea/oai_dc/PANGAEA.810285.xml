Sediment cores were obtained by means of a hydraulic piston corer. All of the cores from this boring were designated for geotechnical studies and were distributed among eight institutions. The results of laboratory studies on these sediment cores were compiled and analyzed. Sediment properties, including physical characteristics, strength, consolidation, and permeability were studied to evaluate changes as a function of depth of burial. It was concluded that the sediment profile to the explored depth of 200 m at Walvis Ridge consists of approximately 50 m of foram-nannofossil marl (Subunit 1a) over 64 m of diatom-nannofossil marl (Subunit 1b) over nannofossil marl (Subunit 1c) to the depth explored. All three sediment units appear to be normally consolidated, although some anomalies seem to exist to a depth of 120 m. No distinct differences were found among the sediment properties of the three subunits (1a, 1b, and 1c) identified at this site.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>75-532, 75-532A, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg75, South Atlantic</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1984-04-16</date></data>
