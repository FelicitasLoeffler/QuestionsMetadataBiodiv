The photographs for each mosaic were acquired using the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) MARUM QUEST 4000m during RV METEOR cruise M112 (2014). Photos were taken from altitudes 1-5 m above seafloor using a Prosilica GT6600C camera vertically mounted on the ROV. The photomosaics were compiled with the LAPM tool (Marcon et al. 2013) and geo-referenced by using the smoothed ultra-short baseline (USBL, IXSEA Posidonia 6k) navigation data of the ROV. Seafloor positioning by USBL has an accuracy better than 10 m, or 0.05-0.2% of the slant range. Photomosaics have been rectified manually in Global Mapper&#174; software based on obvious seafloor structures and are provided in GeoTIFF format (WGS84 coordinate system).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, CT, File format, File name, File size, M112/1, M112-track, MARUM, Meteor (1986), Underway cruise track measurements, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-04-19</date></data>
