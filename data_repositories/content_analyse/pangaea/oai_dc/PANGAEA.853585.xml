Helium filled balloons (TOTEX 600 g, 800 g) were used to carry Vaisala RS80 radiosondes. Whenever possible, the launches were performed about 10 UTC. Condensed measurements (TEMP Format FM-35) were transferred without delay into the Global Telecommunication System GTS were they contribute for the world wide weather forecasts. The profile data were taken every 5-10 seconds which result in a vertical profile resolution of about 25-50 meter. The profiles start at the helideck 10 m above sea level and terminate at the burst level of the balloons, normally at heights between 25 and 37 km.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AWI_Meteo, Meteorological Long-Term Observations @ AWI</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1984-09-28</date></data>
