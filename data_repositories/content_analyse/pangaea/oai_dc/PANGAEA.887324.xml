Surface samples were collected using a trace metal clean sampler fixed to a plastic pole. Samples were taken while the ship was steaming at approximately 1 knot in order to minimize contamination from the ship. All bottles and plasticware were cleaned using trace metal clean procedures outlined in the U.S. GEOTRACES protocols. Unfiltered samples were placed in separate trace metal clean 250 mL low-density polyethylene bottles and immediately acidified to pH 1.8 with 4 mL Optima HCl (Fisher Scientific) and stored until analysis using standard addition methods and cathodic stripping voltammetry 4 months later in the lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adolf Jensen, AJ_201508, AJ_201508_1SWS, AJ_201508_23SWS, AJ_201508_25SWS, AJ_201508_27SWS, AJ_201508_28SWS, AJ_201508_30SWS, AJ_201508_32SWS, AJ_201508_34SWS, AJ_201508_3SWS, AJ_201508_5SWS, AJ_201508_7SWS, DATE/TIME, Iron, dissolvable, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, Sermilik Fjord, SE Greenland, Station label, Surface water sample, SWS</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-03-14</date></data>
