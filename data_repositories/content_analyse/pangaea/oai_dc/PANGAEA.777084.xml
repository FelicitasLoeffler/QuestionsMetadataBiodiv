It is shown that the regular change of bottom sediment types forming a genetic series from the coast to the pelagic zone clearly demonstrates a leading role of biogenic-terrigenous sedimentation in their formation. In the pelagic zone of the ocean erosion of islands and seamounts, basalt volcanism of anticlinal uplifts, as well as exhalative contribution play some role in addition to the main source of terrigenous and pyroclastic material from continents. These sources do not change, but only complicate terrigenous sedimentation in the studied area of the ocean.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aluminium oxide, Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, Calcium oxide, Calculated, Carbon, Carbon dioxide, Depth, bottom/max, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Depth, top/min, DM9, DM9-671, DM9-686, Dmitry Mendeleev, Elevation of event, Event label, GC, Gravity corer, Iron oxide, Fe2O3, Iron oxide, FeO, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, Magnesium oxide, Manganese oxide, Northeast Pacific, North Pacific, Northwest Pacific, Optical microscopy, Phosphorus oxide, Potassium oxide, Refractive index, Sediment type, Silicon dioxide, Sodium oxide, Sum, Titanium dioxide, VITYAZ, Vityaz (ex-Mars), VITYAZ6164-GC, VITYAZ6167-GC, Water in rock, Wet chemistry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1976-03-06</date></data>
