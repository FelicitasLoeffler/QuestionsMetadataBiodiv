We calculated wild birthrate (pregnancy rate) for ten mammal species, using 180 months (from 2000 to 2015) of reproductive data from 950 hunted female animals collected with the participation of local hunters in the Peruvian Amazon. The methodology assured that no animals were killed outside the hunter's normal activities. The data included shows the reproductive state (pregnant or non-pregnant) of all collected individuals (n=1090), related to the date of collection. Hunters registered required data from genital organs from 950 (87.2%) hunted females, and 140 (12.8%) collected tracts lacked the collection date due to lost or non-legible individual sample codification.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biological sample, BIOS, Code, DATE/TIME, Nueva_Esperanza, Peru, Species, Species, common name, Status</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2016-07-01</date></data>
