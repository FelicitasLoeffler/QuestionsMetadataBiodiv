During Leg 81 of the Deep Sea Drilling Project, these reflectors were sampled at Site 553 and proved to consist almost exclusively of basalt. Here we present lead isotope data which indicate that these basalts may have been contaminated by ancient uranium-depleted continental crust, or alternatively, derived from a sub-continental lithospheric mantle source. In either case, the implications are that the basalts of the south-west Rockall Plateau formed by eruption through and onto continental basement, not by 'subaerial seafloor spreading'. This conclusion is in accord with gravity models of the area, which predict stretched continental crust beneath the dipping reflector sequence.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>81-553, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Lead 206/Lead 204 ratio, Lead 207/Lead 204 ratio, Lead 208/Lead 204 ratio, Leg81, North Atlantic/PLATEAU, ODP sample designation, Sample code/label</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1987-09-21</date></data>
