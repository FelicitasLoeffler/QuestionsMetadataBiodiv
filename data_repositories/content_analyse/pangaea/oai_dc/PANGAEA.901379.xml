Each sample was photographed and macroscopically described on board. Grain-size analyses for samples with fractions smaller than 2 mm were carried out with a CILAS 1180 L laser particle sizer (0.04-2500 &#181;m) after chemical treatment according to standard procedures (Hass, H.C., Kuhn, G., Monien, P., Brumsack, H.J., Forwick, M. Climate fluctuations during the past two millennia as recorded in sediments from Maxwell Bay, South Shetland Islands,West Antarctica. Geol. Soc. Lond. Spec. Publ. 2010, 344, 243-260). Samples with fractions larger than 2 mm were additionaly wet sieved.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-05-10</date></data>
