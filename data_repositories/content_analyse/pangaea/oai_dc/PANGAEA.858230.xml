Chemically they consist of predominant Fe (up to 45%) and Mn (up to 12%), with significant amounts of Zn, Ni, Co and Cu. That the REE distribution patterns are similar to those of shallow Pacific derivation - from hydrothermal waters cognate or cycled through volcanic rocks of intermediate composition - is tentatively suggested.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aluminium, Bannock, BAN-T76EL, BAN-T76EN, Calcium, Cerium, Cobalt, Copper, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, Dredge, DRG, Enarete Seamount, Enolo Seamount, Europium, Event label, Identification, Iron, Lanthanum, Loss on ignition, Lutetium, Magnesium, Manganese, Neodymium, Neutron activation analysis, Nickel, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Samarium, Silicon, Substrate type, T76, Terbium, Titanium, Type, Vanadium, Wet chemistry, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Ytterbium</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1980-02-20</date></data>
