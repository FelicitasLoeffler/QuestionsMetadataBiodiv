The images in this dataset have then been undistorted to virtual images that an ideal perspective camera with only 90 degrees horizontal field of view would have seen from the same position. To achieve this, the color of each pixel in the ideal image is obtained by- computing the ray in space associated with this virtual pixel (using rectilinear un-projection)- projecting this ray into the original fisheye image (using equidistant projection), yielding a sub-pixel position- interpolating the colors of the neighboring pixelsTechnically, the undistortion has been performed using the tool https://svn.geomar.de/dsm-general/trunk/src/BIAS/Tools/biasproject.cpp (at revision 418, and earlier, compatible revisions).Manual image annotation is available here: https://annotate.geomar.de/volumes/252</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Acoustic Doppler Current Profiling (ADCP), Autonomous underwater vehicle, AUV, AUV forward velocity, AUV starboard velocity, AUV vertical velocity, Chlorophyll a, Conductivity, CTD, SEA-BIRD SBE 49, DATE/TIME, DEPTH, water, Digital camera, Canon EOS 1100D, Fisheye lens, Distance, File format, File name, File size, Fluorometer, WET Labs ECO FLNTU, French license area, Ground visibility (1=yes/0=no), Heading, Image brightness, JPI Oceans - Ecological Aspects of Deep-Sea Mining, JPIO-MiningImpact, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, Pitch angle, Roll angle, Salinity, SO239, SO239_166-1, SO239_166-1_AUV15, Sonne_2, Sound velocity in water, Temperature, water, Time, relative, Turbidity (Nephelometric turbidity unit), Uniform resource locator/link to image</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-10-20</date></data>
