Smear-slides, thin sections from coarse fractions, and heavy minerals of the sandstone and siltstone beds were analyzed. The sandstones and siltstones are very rich in lithic fragments and are classified as lithic arenite and (or) lithic wacke. Hornblende and clinopyroxene are abundant, and zircon is present in most of the examined samples. The proportions of sandstone, chert, and volcanic rock in the coarse fraction are variable, but fragments of clastic rocks and cherts are predominant. Plagioclase crystals of volcanic-rock origin, such as highly zoned plagioclase and very fine, euhedral, lath-shaped plagioclase, are frequently observed. Metamorphic-rock fragments and metamorphic minerals are also observed. Thus, the provenance of the sandstone and siltstone beds appears to have been a slightly mature island arc, the Oyashio ancient landmass, consisting of clastic sediments and metamorphic and volcanic rocks.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>57-439, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg57, North Pacific/TRENCH</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1980-11-14</date></data>
