The radioisotope 10Be (half-life 1.5 My) is formed by spallation reactions between cosmic rays and 14N, 16O in the atmosphere. It is transferred to the oceans in soluble form by precipitation and dry deposition. The 10Be et 16Al having similar chemical behaviours and being influenced by the same geophysical and geochemical phenomena before being incorporated into the marine sediments, their ratio is tested in order to date those sediments. This approach is also applied to manganese nodules and ferromanganese crusts.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), Aluminium 26, Aluminium 26, standard deviation, Aluminium 27, ARIES, ARIES-012D, ARIES-015D, Beryllium 10, Beryllium 10, standard deviation, Deposit type, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, DISTANCE, Distance, maximum, Distance, minimum, Dredge, DRG, Event label, Identification, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Pacific Ocean, Thomas Washington</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1988-04-04</date></data>
