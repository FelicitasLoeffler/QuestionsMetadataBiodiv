Collection was done using a marine snow catcher (MSC), which is essentially a large (95 L) settling column. The marine snow catcher is deployed to one depth, the water trapped inside and then brought to the surface and left to stand on deck for 2 hours during which time the particles settle down (or up) the MSC depending on their settling rate. The particles are then collected and due to position of collection from the snow catcher are determined as fast or slow sinking particles. Some fluxes are negative as they were positively buoyant and not sinking.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Basin Scale Analysis, Synthesis and Integration, Calculated after Ploug and J&#248;rgensen (1999), Carbon, organic, particulate flux per day, Carbon, organic, particulate mass, DEPTH, water, EURO-BASIN, Event label, James Cook, JC087, JC087-010, JC087-038, JC087-039, JC087-063, JC087-064, JC087-070, JC087-071, JC087-082, JC087-113, JC087-114, JC087-133, Julian day, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, Marine snow catcher, MSC, Porcupine Abyssal Plain, Sample ID, Time in days</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-06-16</date></data>
