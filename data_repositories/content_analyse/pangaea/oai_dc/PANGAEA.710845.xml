The delta34S value of the gypsum (+19.4&#8240;) indicates a seawater source for the sulfate. The delta18O values of the saponite (+19.9&#8240;) and phillipsite (+18.1&#8240;) indicate either formation from normal seawater at about 55&#176;C or formation from delta18O-depleted seawater at a lower temperature.The gypsum (which could be secondary after anhydrite) was formed by reaction between Ca[2+] released from basalt and SO4[2-] in circulating seawater. The halite could have formed when water was consumed by hydration of basalt under conditions of extremely restricted circulation. A more probable mechanism is that the gypsum was originally precipitated as anhydrite at temperatures above 60&#176;C. As the temperature dropped the anhydrite converted to gypsum. The conversion would consume water, which could cause halite precipitation, and would cause an increase in the volume of solids, which would plug the vein and prevent subsequent dissolution of the halite.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>45-395A, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg45, Minerals, ODP sample designation, Sample code/label, &#948;18O, &#948;34S</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1979-12-19</date></data>
