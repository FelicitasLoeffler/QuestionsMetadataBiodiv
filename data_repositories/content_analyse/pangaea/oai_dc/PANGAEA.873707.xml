Although paleoenvironments were to be stressed on Leg 62, studies of igneous rocks from acoustic basement were planned, to determine ages, petrogenesis, alteration effects, rock magnetism, and Paleomagnetism of old parts of the Pacific crust. These studies were emphasized in order to establish the early history of oceanic plateaus and whether they are the result of midocean-ridge or intraplate volcanism.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>62-463, 62-464, 62-465A, 62-466, Comment, Deep Sea Drilling Project, Deposit type, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Event label, Glomar Challenger, Identification, Leg62, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, North Pacific/CONT RISE, North Pacific/SEAMOUNT, Position, Quantity of deposit, Sample code/label, Sediment type, Size, Substrate type, Visual description</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1981-03-21</date></data>
