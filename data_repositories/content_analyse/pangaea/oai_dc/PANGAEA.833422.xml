We use benthic foraminiferal d13C records from the southern East Pacific Rise to characterize the d13C composition of Circumpolar Deep Water in the South Pacific, prior to its transit through the Drake Passage into the South Atlantic. A comparison with published South Atlantic deep water records from the northern Cape Basin suggests a continuous water mass exchange throughout the past 500 ka. Almost identical glacial-interglacial d13C variations imply a common deep water evolution in both basins suggesting persistent Circumpolar Deep Water exchange and homogenization. By contrast, deeper abyssal waters occupying the more southern Cape Basin and the southernmost South Atlantic have lower d13C values during most, but not all, stadial periods. We conclude that these values represent the influence of a more southern water mass, perhaps AABW. During many interglacials and some glacial periods, the gradient between Circumpolar Deep Water and the deeper southern Cape Basin bottom water disappears suggesting either no presence of AABW or indistinguishable d13C values of both water masses.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AWI_Paleo, Paleoenvironmental Reconstructions from Marine Sediments @ AWI</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2016-06-18</date></data>
