Microbiological studies deal with different groups of bacteria. Regularities of quantitative distribution and the role of microorganisms in geochemical processes are under consideration. Geochemical studies highlight redox processes of the early stages of sediment diagenesis, alterations of interstitial waters, regularities of variations in chemical composition of iron-manganese nodules.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, DM9, DM9-657, DM9-659, DM9-660, DM9-661, DM9-662, DM9-663, DM9-664, DM9-665, DM9-666, DM9-667, DM9-668, DM9-669, DM9-670, DM9-671, DM9-672, DM9-673, DM9-674, Dmitry Mendeleev, GC, Grab, GRAB, Gravity corer, Northeast Pacific</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1976-08-16</date></data>
