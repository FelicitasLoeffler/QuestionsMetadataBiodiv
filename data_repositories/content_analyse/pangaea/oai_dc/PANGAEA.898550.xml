Every spectrum has an individual timestamp. Positions of each spectrum can be localized by joining the GPS data with the spectral data on the datetime of the measurement.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Arctic Ocean, ARK-XXXI/1.1,PASCAL, Event label, File content, File format, File name, File size, ICE, Ice station, Number, Polarstern, PS106_22-1, PS106_24-2, PS106_32-2, PS106/1, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-02-18</date></data>
