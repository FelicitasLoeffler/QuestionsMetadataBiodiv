Growth and cell size in light microscopy, morphology and coccolith size in scanning electron microscopy, particulate nitrogen (PN) and particulate inorganic and organic carbon (PIC and POC) content of the coccolithophore were investigated during the light and dark phases. Dissolved inorganic nutrient (nitrate and phosphate) concentrations and pH of the medium and the presence of heterotrophic prokaryotes (HP) were monitored as well.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ammonium, Carbon, inorganic, particulate, Carbon, organic, particulate, Cell, DATE/TIME, Day of experiment, ECO2, Length, Nitrate, Nitrite, Nitrogen, total particulate, Phosphate, Prokaryotes, heterotroph, Silicon dioxide, Species, Sub-seabed CO2 Storage: Impact on Marine Ecosystems, Treatment, Width</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-07-08</date></data>
