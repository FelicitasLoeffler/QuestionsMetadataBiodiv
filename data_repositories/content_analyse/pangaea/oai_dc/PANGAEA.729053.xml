Spores, pollen, acritarchs, freshwater algae, and dinoflagellate cysts were studied to establish a palynostratigraphic framework for the Late Triassic.The palynological sequence is interpreted in terms of Australian spore-pollen zones: the Carman Samaropollenites speciosus Zone, the Norian Minutosaccus crenulatus Zone, and the Rhaetian Ashmoripollis reducta Zone. The Samaropollenites speciosus Zone-Minutosaccus crenulatus Zone boundary is marked by the change of pollen abundance and has a gradual character. Therefore, a transitional uppermost Carnian to Norian Samaropollenites speciosus/Minutosaccus crenulatus Zone is used. Age-determining dinoflagellate cysts are present in the Norian and Rhaetian sediments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>122-759B, 122-760A, 122-760B, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg122, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, South Indian Ridge, South Indian Ocean</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1992-11-10</date></data>
