Taking also into account previous sampling data, in moving from west to east across the margin, the nature of the basement changes drastically.To the west there are mostly Hercynian basement rocks with their cover, referable to the alpine foreland of the Corsica-Sardinia block. To the east, along the lower margin, where crustal thinning is quite severe, the basement contains rock suites referable to a pre-upper Tortonian orogenized zone with units constituting parts of the Alpine and Apenninic chains (presumably with thickened continental crust prior to stretching). Largest thinning and ocean forming occurred then, in a rather short time, mostly at the expense of unstable crust just thickened by orogenetic/tectogenetic processes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>107-652A, 107-653B, 107-654A, 107-656B, Amphibole, Anhydrite, Apatite, Biotite, Carbonate, Chlorite, Chloritoid, Clinopyroxene, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Epidote, Event label, Garnet, Joides Resolution, Leg107, Magnetite, Monazite, Muscovite, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, ODP sample designation, Opaque minerals, Rutile, Sample code/label, Sillimanite, Staurolite, Tirreno Sea, Tourmaline, Zircon</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1990-09-24</date></data>
