The two zipped folders contain Seismic Analysis Code (SAC) files of seismic waveforms processed to work with MuRAT5, a computational code available at https://github.com/LucaDeSiena/MuRAT.MuRAT5 is the updated version of MuRAT (Multiple Resolution Reliable Attenuation Tomography Analysis): doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.871091.The two datasets are necessary to perform attenuation imaging at Mount St. Helens volcano and Romania.The two zipped folders have to be downloaded, unzipped, and moved to the MURAT5 working directory.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-09-11</date></data>
