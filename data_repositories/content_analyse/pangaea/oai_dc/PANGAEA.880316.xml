Accordingly, several studies have addressed its trigger mechanisms, absolute dating and regional characteristics so far. However, knowledge about subsequent climate recovery is still limited although this might be essential for the understanding of rapid climatic changes. Here we present a new sub-decadally resolved and precisely dated oxygen isotope (d18O) record for the interval between 7.7 and 8.7 ka BP, derived from the calcareous valves of benthic ostracods preserved in the varved lake sediments of pre-Alpine Mondsee (Austria). Besides a clear reflection of the 8.2 ka event, showing a good agreement in timing, duration and magnitude with other regional stable isotope records, the high-resolution Mondsee lake sediment record provides evidence for a 75-year-long interval of higher-than-average d18O values directly after the 8.2 ka event, possibly reflecting increased air temperatures in Central Europe. This observation is consistent with evidence from other proxy records in the North Atlantic realm, thus most probably reflecting a hemispheric-scale climate signal rather than a local phenomenon. As a possible trigger we suggest an enhanced resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), supporting assumptions from climate model simulations.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AGE, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Lake Mondsee, European Alps, Mo05, Ostracoda, &#948;18O, PCUWI, Piston corer, UWITEC, Reconstructed, Varve age, &#948;18O, water</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-09-04</date></data>
