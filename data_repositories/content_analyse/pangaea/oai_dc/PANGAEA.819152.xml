We first dried the 3-5 cm**3 sediment samples at 105&#176;-110&#176;C (some shallow sediments used for the C-H-N analyses were dried at 45-55 &#176;C) and then ground them to a homogeneous powder. The ground sediment was redried and two samples (0.1 g and 0.5 g) were then weighed in LECO clay crucibles. The 0.5-g sample was acidified with a 10% hydrochloric acid solution and then washed with distilled water. We then dried and analyzed the sample for acid-insoluble carbon, listed in Table 1 as "organic" carbon. The 0.1-g sample was analyzed for total carbon without further treatment. If the result showed less than 10% CaCO3, we analyzed an additional 0.5-g sample for greater accuracy.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>64-474, 64-474A, 64-475, 64-475B, 64-476, 64-477, 64-477A, 64-477B, 64-478, 64-479, 64-480, 64-481, 64-481A, Calcium carbonate, Calculated, see reference(s), Carbon, organic, total, Carbon, total, Carbon/Nitrogen ratio, Carbonate bomb (M&#252;ller &amp; Gastner, 1971), Deep Sea Drilling Project, DEPTH, sediment/rock, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Element analyser CHN, LECO, Elevation of event, Event label, Glomar Challenger, Latitude of event, Leg64, Longitude of event, Nitrogen, organic, North Pacific/Gulf of California/BASIN, North Pacific/Gulf of California/CHANNEL, North Pacific/Gulf of California/SLOPE, North Pacific/Gulf of California/TERRACE, ODP sample designation, Sample code/label</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1982-09-07</date></data>
