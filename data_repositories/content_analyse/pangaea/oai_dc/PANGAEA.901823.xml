The data set offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses related to short- and long-range feedback processes in space and time between the different interacting compartments of the terrestrial system. The physical consistency of simulated states and fluxes in the terrestrial system constitutes the uniqueness of the data set: while most regional climate models (RCMs) have a tendency to simplify the soil moisture and groundwater representation, TerrSysMP explicitly simulates the full 3D soil- and groundwater dynamics, closing the terrestrial water cycle from G2A. Anthropogenic impacts are excluded, the dataset may serve therefore as a near-natural reference for global change simulations including human water use and climate change. The data set is available as netCDF files.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>coupled simulation, File format, File name, File size, groundwater to atmosphere, MULT, Multiple investigations, Pan-Europe, terrestrial system, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-05-17</date></data>
