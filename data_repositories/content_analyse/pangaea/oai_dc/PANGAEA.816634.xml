According to magnetic and petrographic data, the basalts are altered to different degrees. We determined the ratio Ist/Iso and the Curie points of the basalts. In Hole 504B there is vertical zoning of titanomagnetite alteration: in the upper part of the basement, low temperature titanomaghemitization predominates (IST/Iso &gt; 1), in the lower part of the hole, multi-phase alteration (IST/Iso &lt; 1) predominates. This is evidence for superimposition of multi-phase alteration after single-phase oxidation. The latter process occurred at low temperatures. Multi-phase alteration is represented by exsolution and unmixing of titanomagnetite. Its appearance is connected with extended secondary heating at temperatures of about 100&#176;C, documented by thermal measurements in the hole. Magnetic properties of basalts from Site 505 are typical of submarine pillow lavas that contain fine-grained titanomaghemite.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>69-504A, 69-504B, 69-505A, 69-505B, 70-504B, Coercivity of remanence, Curie temperature, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Elevation of event, Event label, Glomar Challenger, Koenigsberger ratio, Latitude of event, Leg69, Leg70, Longitude of event, Median demagnetizing field, Natural remanent magnetization, North Pacific/GRABEN, ODP sample designation, Ratio, Sample code/label, Saturation magnetization, Susceptibility</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1983-07-17</date></data>
