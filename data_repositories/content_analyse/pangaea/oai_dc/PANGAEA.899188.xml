An initial age model based on 14 calcareous nannofossil datums, 5 planktonic foraminiferal biostratigraphic events and 12 magnetic polarity reversals is refined by planktonic foraminiferal Globigerinoides sacculifer (300-355&#8239;&#956;m) &#948;18O stratigraphy. The planktonic &#948;18O record with an average 3-4 kyr resolution matches the global stack LR04 (Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005). The 41-kyr obliquity and 100-kyr eccentricity patterns show good correlation between the LR04 and the dataset presented herein. The precession amplitude matches eccentricity, supporting the established stratigraphy. Sedimentation rates at Hole 1115B have decreased from 9.3 to 4.5&#8239;cm/kyr during the past 3.2&#8239;Ma toward present, mainly due to the gradual deepening of the Woodlark Basin. The planktonic &#948;18O record from Site 1115 matches the global climate evolution well.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-03-08</date></data>
