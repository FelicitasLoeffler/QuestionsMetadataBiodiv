The modern western Arabian Sea surface waters are highly influenced by the monsoonal wind system. Summer upwelling, a result of southwestern winds, occurs along the coast of Somalia which produces distinct foraminiferal assemblages which are dominated by G. bulloides d'Orbigny. Consequently, variations in the distribution record of G. bulloides through time monitor the upwelling history associated with monsoonal activities. G. bulloides was a minor constituent of the foraminiferal fauna from the bottom of the hole (~14.5 Ma) until about 8.6 Ma ago. Then a rapid shift occurred toward higher values, up to 53% at 7.4 Ma. We interpret this rapid increase as a major step in the evolution of the monsoonal history. It is either the establishment of the system or at least a strong intensification of the monsoonal winds. At 5.5 Ma a significant drop of the G. bulloides relative abundance occurred which may indicate less upwelling, or alternatively other biota may have been favored in this period. From 5.0 Ma to Recent the G. bulloides record indicates that upwelling has occurred with minor fluctuations.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>117-722A, 117-722B, Arabian Sea, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg117, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1991-02-02</date></data>
