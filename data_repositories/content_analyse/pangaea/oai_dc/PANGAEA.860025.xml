In the central Black Sea, the aim of TTR-6 the investigation was a bathymetric map of a field of mud volcanoes known from the previous TTR cruises, during transit. In the Sorokin Trough, where gas hydrates were earlier obtained from sea bottom sediments the primary goals concerned the elucidation of the structure of clay diapiric folds and the searching for mud volcanoes and other evidence for fluid flux through the seafloor. The task of looking for the seafloor manifestation of deep fluid emanation was set in the Pallas Uplift area. The EM12s surveying on the Caucasian margin was aimed at the construction of the first detailed bathymetric map of this area.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ANAXIPROBE/TTR-6, Bathymetry, Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, CT, File content, File format, File name, File size, Gelendzhik, MARUM, MBES, TTR-6/2, TTR-6/2-track, Underway cruise track measurements, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2016-04-29</date></data>
