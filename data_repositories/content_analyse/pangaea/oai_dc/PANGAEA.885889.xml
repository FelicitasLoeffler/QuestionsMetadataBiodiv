To understand the flexibility of Antarctic krill's seasonal cycle, we investigated its physiological and behavioural response to different light regimes and if an endogenous timing system was involved in the regulation of these seasonal processes. We analysed growth, feeding, lipid content and maturity in a two-year lab experiment simulating the latitudinal light regimes 52&#176;S, 66&#176;S and constant darkness under constant food level. Our results showed that light regime affected seasonal cycles of growth, lipid metabolism and maturity in Antarctic krill. Seasonal patterns of growth and maturity persisted under constant darkness indicating the presence of an endogenous timing system. The maturity cycle showed differences in development and critical photoperiods according to the simulated light regime. This suggests a flexible endogenous timing mechanism in Antarctic krill, which may determine its response to future environmental changes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Carapax, dry mass, Carapax length, Comment, DATE/TIME, Digestive gland length, Euphausia superba, maturity score, Euphausia superba, relative digestive gland length to carapax length, Experiment duration, Lipids, Maturity score after Brown et al.
