A single in situ modiolid bivalve fragment at 10.88 mbsf gives an age of 30.9 (&#177;0.8) Ma for the associated sediment. The four remaining well preserved fragments recovered from 29.94-190.31 mbsf are within error of this age, indicating a high sedimentation rate and suggesting little time is missing in disconformities. The diagenetic alteration of carbonate macrofossils by continental fluids (and possibly seawater) is a common feature to 320 mbsf.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Age, dated, Age, dated, range, maximum, Age, dated, range, minimum, Age, strontium isotope, LOWESS fit Howarth &amp; McArthur (1997), Cape Roberts Project, Comment, Core wireline system, CRP, CRP-3, CWS, Depth, bottom/max, Depth, top/min, Isotope ratio mass spectrometry, Lithologic unit/sequence, Preservation, Ross Sea, Sample type, Sampling/drilling from ice, Shell debris, Strontium 87/Strontium 86, Strontium 87/Strontium 86, error</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2001-04-22</date></data>
