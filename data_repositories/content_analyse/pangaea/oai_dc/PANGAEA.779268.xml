The ranges for the properties are large, as typified by the velocity, which varies from 3.46 to 6.59 km/s. Extensively altered basalts immediately above and below a silicified hydrothermal deposit (60-69 m sub-basement depth) at Site 801 display the highest porosity, and lowest bulk density, velocity, and thermal conductivity, whereas the slightly altered rocks from Site 802 and the lowermost part of Site 801 represent the other extreme in physical properties variations. In order to better establish the relationship between physical properties and alteration of the rocks, the compressional wave velocities were compared with results from major and trace elemental analyses and petrographic examination of select samples. For the Leg 129 basalts, velocity displays a generally consistent decrease with increasing K2O, H2O+, loss on ignition, and Rb contents and the value of Fe3+/FeT and decreasing concentrations of SiO2, FeOT, CaO, MgO, and MnO. These trends are consistent with trends documented for the progressive alteration of oceanic crust and indicate that on a laboratory sample scale, basalt alteration is largely responsible for the variation of the physical properties of basalts sampled at Sites 800, 801, and 802.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>129-800A, 129-801B, 129-801C, 129-802A, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg129, North Pacific Ocean, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1992-04-13</date></data>
