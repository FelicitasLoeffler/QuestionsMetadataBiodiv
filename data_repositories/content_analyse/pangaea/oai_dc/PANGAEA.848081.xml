A timescale based on magnetic polarity chrons, oxygen isotope stratigraphy (for the last 1Myr) and orbital tuning was developed. The record documents a stepwise inception of large-scale glacial cycles in the Nordic Seas region, the first being a marked expansion of the Greenland ice sheet at 3.3 Ma. A second step occurred at 2.74 Ma by an expansion of large scale ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Ice sheet variability around the Nordic Seas was tightly coupled to global ice volume over the past 3.3 Myr. Between 3 and 1 Ma, most of the variance of the IRD signal is in the 41 kyr band, whereas the last 1 Myr is characterized by stronger 100 kyr variance. The Gamma Ray Porosity Evaluator (GRAPE) density record is closely linked with IRD variations and documents sub orbital variability resembling the late Quaternary Heinrich/Bond cycles.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2000-07-13</date></data>
