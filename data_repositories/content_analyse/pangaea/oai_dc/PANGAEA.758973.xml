At some stations contents of these elements were also measured in Pleistocene and Oligocene sediments. Elevated contents of five ore elements (except for Zn) were found at the East Pacific Rise and in the Clarion-Clipperton province, and of Mn, Ni, and Cu in the Guatemala basin. Increased zinc contents occur only in sediments of the East Pacific Rise and Guatemala Basin. Enrichment of sediments in these elements results from under&#172;water hydrothermal activity and high biological productivity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), Calcium, Calcium carbonate, Carbon, organic, total, Carbon analyser AN-7529, 7560, Chromium, Cobalt, Copper, Depth, bottom/max, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Depth, top/min, DM41, DM41-3830-28, DM41-3833-14, DM41-3839, DM41-3850, DM41-3852, Dmitry Mendeleev, Double leaching by 5% Na2CO3, Elevation of event, Epoch, Event label, Gas volumetric, GC, Gravity corer, Iron, Latitude of event, Lithium, Longitude of event, Magnesium, Manganese, Nickel, Opal, biogenic silica, Pacific Ocean, Phosphorus, Potassium, Rubidium, Sediment type, Sodium, Titanium, Wet chemistry, Zinc</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1991-04-06</date></data>
