At Site 690 (Maud Rise), a convex upward shaped temperature vs. depth profile was observed. This profile cannot be explained by steady-state conduction through solid materials only. We conclude that the minimum heat flow value at Site 690 is 45 mW/m2. A prominent bottom simulating reflector (BSR) was observed at 600 mbsf at Site 695. However, the observed temperature is too high to explain the BSR as a gas hydrate. The origin of the BSR remains unknown, although it is probably of biogenic origin as observed in the Bering Sea during DSDP Leg 19. After correcting for the effects of sedimentation, heat flow values at Sites 695 and 696 are 69 and 63 mW/m2, respectively. Furthermore, we compiled heat flow data south of 50&#176;S. In the Weddell Sea region, the eastern part shows relatively low heat flow in comparison with the western part, with the boundary between them at about 15&#176;W longitude.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>113-689B, 113-690B, 113-695A, 113-696A, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg113, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, South Atlantic Ocean, Weddell Sea</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1990-08-03</date></data>
