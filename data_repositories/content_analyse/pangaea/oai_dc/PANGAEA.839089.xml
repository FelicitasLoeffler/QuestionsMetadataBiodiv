It carried out extensive measurements of evironmental conditions and collected plankton (viruses, bacteria, protists and metazoans) for later analysis using modern sequencing and state-of-the-art imaging technologies. Tara Oceans Data are particularly suited to study the genetic, morphological and functional diversity of plankton. The present data set includes properties of seawater, particulate matter and dissolved matter that were measured from discrete water samples collected with Niskin bottles during the 2009-2013 Tara Oceans expedition. Properties include pigment concentrations from HPLC analysis (10 depths per vertical profile, 25 pigments per depth), the carbonate system (Surface and 400m, pH (total scale), CO2, pCO2, fCO2, HCO3, CO3, Total alkalinity, Total carbon, OmegaAragonite, OmegaCalcite, and dosage Flags), nutrients (10 depths per vertical profile, NO2, PO4, N02/NO3, SI, quality Flags), DOC, CDOM, and dissolved oxygen isotopes. The Service National d'Analyse des Param&#232;tres Oc&#233;aniques du CO2, at the Universit&#233; Pierre et Marie Curie, determined CT and AT potentiometrically. More than 200 vertical profiles of these properties were made across the world ocean. DOC, CDOM and dissolved oxygen isotopes are available only for the Arctic Ocean and Arctic Seas (2013).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>[RVSS], 6=below detection limit, 1=good sample (Picheral et al. 2014), Basis of event, Bottle number, Buenos Aires to Ushuaia, Stations: TARA_079b-083, Campaign of event, Comment of event, Conductivity, Date/Time of event, Density, sigma-theta (0), DEPTH, water, derived from CTD, SEA-BIRD, Device of event, Event label, File name, Fondation Tara Expeditions, FondTara, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, Nitrate and Nitrite, Nitrite, Optional event label, Phosphate, Pressure, water, Quality flag, Rosette Vertical Sampling System, Salinity, Silicate, Station label, SV Tara, TARA_20101126Z, TARA_20101206T1026Z_082_EVENT_CAST, TARA_20101206T1639Z_082_EVENT_CAST, Tara Oceans Expedition, Temperature, water, Temperature, water, potential, TOE-2009-2013, URI of event</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-11-19</date></data>
