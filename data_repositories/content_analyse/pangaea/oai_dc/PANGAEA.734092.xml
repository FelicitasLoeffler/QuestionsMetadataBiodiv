Pollen, radiocarbon datings, and geochemical data were used to develop the chronology of the Late-Glacial Period in Lake Faulersee and to validate interpretations made by chironomid data. Factors influencing the composition of the subfossil chironomid assemblages were assessed. Our data indicate fluctuations of temperature, lake-level, and trophic state in the Late-Glacial. Furthermore, we explain a discontinuous sequence found in the cores of Lake Faulersee pertaining to a refilling event about 5,800 cal years before present (BP).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Changes in the Geo-Biosphere during the last 15000 years, FAU_1c, FAU_2a, Fauler See, GeoBio15k, LakeSedFauler_See, PD, Peat drill, Sampling/drilling in lake</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2004-02-25</date></data>
