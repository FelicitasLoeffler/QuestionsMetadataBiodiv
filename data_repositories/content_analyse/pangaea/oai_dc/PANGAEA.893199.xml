Gridded monthly mean climatologies were constructed by mapping and avereaging along isobaths of available ship-based and seal (meop.net) CTD data from 1977 to 2016 between 10W and 25W. See Hattermann (2018), Antarctic thermocline dynamics along a narrow shelf with easterly winds, JPO, for further details.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Filchner Ice Shelf Project, FISP, KappNorvegia, Kapp Norvegia, MULT, Multiple investigations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-08-23</date></data>
