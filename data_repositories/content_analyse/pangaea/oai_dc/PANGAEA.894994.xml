Two sediment cores were extracted from Robinson Lake and were analyzed for organic matter content, sediment grain size, and a range of elements and elemental ratios determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>None</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-10-04</date></data>
