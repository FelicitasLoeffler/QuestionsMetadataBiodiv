The Miocene section at Site 1007, located at the toe-of-slope, contains a relatively high proportion of bank-derived components and becomes fully lithified at a depth of ~300 meters below seafloor (mbsf). By contrast, Miocene sediments at Site 1006, situated in Neogene drift deposits in the Straits of Florida and composed primarily of pelagic carbonates, do not become fully lithified until a depth of ~675 mbsf. Diagenetic and compositional contrasts between Sites 1006 and 1007 are reflected in geochemical data derived from sediment samples from each site.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2000-11-13</date></data>
