However, the reason for the non-changing POC fluxes at depths is unknown. This study presents direct measurements of formation, degradation, and sinking velocity of diatom aggregates from laboratory studies performed at 15 &#176;C and 4 &#176;C during a three-week experiment. The average carbon-specific respiration rate during the experiment was 0.12 &#177; 0.03 at 15 &#176;C, and decreased 3.5-fold when the temperature was lowered to 4 &#176;C. No direct influence of temperature on aggregate sinking speed was observed. Using the remineralisation rate measured at 4 &#176;C and an average particle sinking speed of 150 m d**-1, calculated carbon fluxes were similar to those collected in deep ocean sediment traps from a global data set, indicating that temperature plays a major role for deep ocean fluxes of POC.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AWI_Paleo, Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, MARUM, Paleoenvironmental Reconstructions from Marine Sediments @ AWI</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2013-01-30</date></data>
