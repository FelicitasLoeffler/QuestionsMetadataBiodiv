In the Main Experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established from a pool of 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained by bi-annual weeding and mowing. In 2003, plant height was recorded twice a year just before biomass harvest (during peak standing biomass in late May and in late August). For 30 target plant individuals harvested at 10 cm distances along a 5 m transect in a control area at the margin of each experimental plot, vegetative height (length of the main axis) was measured as the length of the main axis of the plant.  Provided is the mean over the measured plants per plot.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Date/time end, Date/time start, EXP, Experiment, Experimental plot, HEIGHT above ground, Height aboveground, maximum, Height aboveground, minimum, Jena Experiment 2003, JenExp, JenExp_2003, Replicate, Sown plant community, regenerative height, Sown plant community, vegetative height, The Jena Experiment, Thuringia, Germany, Treatment: aboveground: pesticide, Treatment: below pesticide, Treatment: drought, Treatment: eartworm exclosure, Treatment: fertilizing, Treatment: molluscide, Treatment: mowing, Treatment: nematicide, Treatment: phytometers, Treatment: seed addition, Treatment: special, Treatment: weeding, Treatment: weeding history</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2015-11-16</date></data>
