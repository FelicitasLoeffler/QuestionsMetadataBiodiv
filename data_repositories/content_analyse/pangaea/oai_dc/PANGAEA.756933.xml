Clastic rocks have arkosic composition and are formed by alteration of basalts and metamorphic rocks. Metaeffusives were formed from basaltoid products of oceanic tholeiite magma indicating that underwater rise structures of the northern Sea of Japan were emplaced on the oceanic crust.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, Dredge, DRG, Perv20-903, Perv20-906, Perv33-1733, Perv34-2032, Perv34-2034, Perv34-2036, Perv34-2038, Perv37-2186, Perv37-2215, Perv37-2216, Perv37-2217, Perv37-2218, Sea of Japan</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1988-02-04</date></data>
