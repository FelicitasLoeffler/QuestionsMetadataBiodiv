An age model constructed is based on correlation with several adjacent cores, for which AMS radiocarbon datings are available. Lithostratigraphic correlation made it possible to compare stratigraphic division of Core ASV16-1372 with other cores sampled on the Voring Plateau and the shelf and continental slope off Central Norway. It is concluded that compositional and structural features of bottom sediments are correlated with paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic changes, variations in provenances, as well as agents and pathways of sedimentary material transport.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, ASV16-1372, Norwegian Sea</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2005-07-18</date></data>
