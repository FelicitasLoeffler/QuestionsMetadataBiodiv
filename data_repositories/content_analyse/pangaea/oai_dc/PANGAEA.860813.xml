Previous researches using SEM observation on marine Mn nodules have revealed many characteristic features which may relate to their formation. They report the discovery of in situ calcareous nannoplankton fossils in a Mn nodule collected during the RV Hakuho-Maru Cruise KH-74-4, and present a preliminary calculation of the growth rate, using a biostratigraphic method. They also discuss the potential value of Mn nodule biostratigraphy in terms of deep sea palaeoenvironments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Comment, Deposit type, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, Dredge, DRG, Hakuho-Maru, Identification, KH-74-4, KH74-4-16, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Pacific Ocean, Position, Quantity of deposit, Sediment type, Size, Substrate type, Uniform resource locator/link to image, Visual description</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1976-05-26</date></data>
