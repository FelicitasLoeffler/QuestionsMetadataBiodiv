In the present paper we propose to point out the distribution of the oxides of manganese in the geological series of rocks, in fresh and sea water, and in marine deposits, with special reference to our explorations in the lochs of the west of Scotland, to give an account of investigations undertaken to ascertain the source of the manganese present in marine deposits in the form of the higher oxides, and thereafter to discuss the various views that have been advanced to explain the formation and distribution of manganese concretions in marine deposits in general.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Dredge, DRG, Firth_of_Clyde_S, Firth of Clyde, Scotland, Grab, GRAB, Loch_Fyne_B, Loch_Fyne_P, Loch_Goil_B, Loch_Striven_C, Loch Fyne, Scotland, Loch Goil, Scotland, Loch Striven, Scotland, Medusa189xx, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, SYM_1872, SY Mallard, SY Medusa (1882)</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1895-08-28</date></data>
