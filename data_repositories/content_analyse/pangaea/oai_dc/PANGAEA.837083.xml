Our results confirm the antiphase correlation between enhanced North Atlantic Deep Water formation and low ventilation in the Mediterranean. However, this study reveals that this antiphase relationship in deepwater formation between the North Atlantic and Mediterranean was interrupted during times of HE when the injection of large volumes of water from melting icebergs reached the entrance to the Mediterranean. These events, which lasted less than 1000 years, are represented by pronounced decreases in both planktonic d18O and benthic d13C signals. Lower salinities of Mediterranean surface water resulted in a slowdown of western Mediterranean deepwater overturn even though cold sea surface temperatures and drier climate should have resulted in enhanced deepwater formation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>98, Age, 14C AMS, Age, comment, Age, dated, Age, dated standard deviation, Calendar age, CALYPSO, Calypso Corer, DEPTH, sediment/rock, IMAGES V, Marion Dufresne, MD114, MD99-2343, North Minorca</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2005-10-22</date></data>
