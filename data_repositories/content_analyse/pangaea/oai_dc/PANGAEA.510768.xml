Measured d18O values average +2.5 &#8240; in the early Miocene and range between +1.26 to +3.24 &#8240; in the early Oligocene. The results show that palaeoceanographic conditions in McMurdo Sound during the mid-Cenozoic were significantly different from those of today. The minimum estimated spring through late summer seasonal temperature range was 3&#176;C during the early Miocene and between 1 and 5&#176;C during the early Oligocene. This compares to the equivalent modern day range of &lt;0.5&#176;C within the sound. Absolute seawater temperatures at &lt;100 m depth were of the order of 5 to 7&#176;C during both time slices, compared to modern day values of -1.4 to - 1.9&#176;C in the same area. The results are in broad agreement with early Oligocene Mg/Ca temperature estimates from deep Atlantic foraminifera as well as estimates from local terrestrial palynology and palaeobotany.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>14.2 km at 096&#176; true from Cape Roberts, Cape Roberts Project, Core wireline system, CRP, CRP-2, CRP-3, CWS, off Cape Roberts, Ross Sea, Antarctica, Ross Sea, Sampling/drilling from ice</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2001-04-22</date></data>
