The MIS 12/11 transition at Lake El'gygytgyn is characterized by initial warming followed by a cold reversal implying similarities to the last deglaciation. The thermal maximum of MIS 11c is characterized by full and remarkably stable interglacial conditions with mean temperatures of the warmest month (MTWM) ranging between ca. 10-15 &#176;C, annual precipitation (PANN) ranging between ca. 300-600 mm, strong in-lake productivity coinciding with dark coniferous forests in the catchment, annual disintegration of the lake ice cover, and full mixis of the water column. Such conditions persisted, according to our age model, for ca. 27 &#177; 8 kyr between ca. 425-398 ka. The Lake El'gygytgyn record closely resembles the climate pattern recorded in Lake Baikal (SE Siberia) sediments and Antarctic ice cores, implying interhemispheric climate connectivity during MIS 11c.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>AGE, Carbon, organic, total, COMPCORE, Composite Core, ELGYGYTGYN, Elgygytgyn crater lake, Sibiria, Russia, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ICDP_Elgygytgyn-Drilling-Project, ICDP5011-1, Lake Elgygytgyn - Climate History of the Arctic since 3.6 Million Years, Opal, biogenic silica, Sampling on land</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2014-02-15</date></data>
