The model is based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and the assimilation is performed by a local Error Subspace TransformKalman filter (LESTKF) coded in the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>File content, File format, File name, File size, Uniform resource locator/link to file</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-06-28</date></data>
