The following types of sediments have been observed: varved and non-varved late-glacial clays, gray and black, post-glacial muds, and sands. The organic content of late-glacial clays ordinarily is less than 1.3 per cent, and of post-glacial muds more than 3 per cent. Sediments containing intermediate quantities are scarce. This can be explained as a result of the changed balance between organic and inorganic sedimentation when the glacial period ended, the abundance of fresh detritus then suddenly ceased and inorganic sedimentation became very much slower than before, consequently, the relative amount of organic detritus increased. As most of the material was not subjected to biological analysis, it has not been possible to distinguish different ages among post-glacial sediments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Baltic Sea, Clast shape, Date/Time of event, Deposit type, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, Dredge, DRG, Elevation of event, Event label, GRIP-F12, GRIP-F23, GRIP-F29A, GRIP-F30A, GRIP-F31, GRIP-F37, GRIP-F38, GRIP-F38B, GRIP-F43, GRIP-F48, GRIP-F55, GRIP-F57, GRIP-F6, GRIP-F7, GRIP-F74, GRIP-F9, GRIP-Hundoren, GRIP-Kobba_Klintar, GRIP-Porkkala, GRIP-Villingin, Latitude of event, Longitude of event, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Page(s), Position, Quantity of deposit, Sample ID, Sediment type, Size, Substrate type</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1934-01-11</date></data>
