Additionally, three drained direct-shear experiments were performed on samples of this section representing the sedimentary transition from overlying homogeneous background sedimentation of silty clay to the volcanoclastic layer.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, MARUM</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2016-11-16</date></data>
