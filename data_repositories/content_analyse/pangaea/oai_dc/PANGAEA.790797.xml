The concentration of aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are shown to match their concentrations in water areas with steady input of pollutants. Weathered oil and pyrogenic compounds dominated in their composition. The geochemical barrier the Northern Dvina River-Dvina Gulf is shown to become a filter during floods and prevents pollutants from penetrating into the White Sea.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2007-10-11</date></data>
