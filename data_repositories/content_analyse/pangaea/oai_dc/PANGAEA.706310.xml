An increase in explosive volcanism in the Kamchatka-Kurile and Aleutian arcs occured at this same time, suggesting a link between volcanism and glaciation. Sediments recovered by piston-coring techniques during ODP Leg 145 provide a unique opportunity to undertake a detailed test of this possibility. Here we use volcanic glass as a proxy for explosive volcanism and ice-rafted debris (IRD) as a proxy for glaciation. The MAR of both glass and IRD increase markedly at 2.65 Ma. Further, the flux of the volcanic glass increased just prior the flix of ice-radted material, suggesting that the cooling resulting from explosive volcanic eruptions may have been the ultimate trigger for the mid-Pliocene glacial intensification.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>145-882, 145-883, 145-887, COMPCORE, Composite Core, Joides Resolution, Leg145, North Pacific Ocean, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2001-10-22</date></data>
