These sites lie in a transect roughly west to east across the basin from the Lau Ridge remnant arc to near the active spreading center. The main objective of the biostratigraphic studies was to date the base of the sedimentary section, immediately overlying basement at each site. Material from all these sites yielded calcareous nannofossils. Site 834, which is closest to the Lau Ridge, yielded floras from Holocene to possible late Miocene age. Site 836, furthest from the remnant arc, produced nannofossils of middle Pleistocene age at the base of the sedimentary section. Reworked material was noted from all sites but caused correlation problems only at Site 835.One new taxon, Discoaster ono, is described from Pliocene sediments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1994-11-13</date></data>
