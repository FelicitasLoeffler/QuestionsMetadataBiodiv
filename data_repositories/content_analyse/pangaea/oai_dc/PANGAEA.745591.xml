Geological analyses of Sites 646 and 647 indicate that sedimentation is primarily controlled by bottom currents having periodic turbidite sequences and no significant hiatuses. Consolidation tests on a limited number of good quality subsamples and other supporting data show that sediments deeper than approximately 5 to at least 150 meters below seafloor (mbsf) are significantly underconsolidated (i.e., these sediments are still consolidating under the existing overburden stresses) and have overconsolidation ratios of less than 0.4 below 50 mbsf. Possible explanations for this underconsolidation include relatively high rates of sedimentation (up to 80 m/m.y.), low permeability layers, an upper zone (~5 m) of apparently overconsolidated sediment, high concentrations of siliceous microfossils, and the existence of nonlinear flow behavior at low hydraulic gradients.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>105-646A, 105-646B, 105-647B, Coefficient, Compression index, DEPTH, sediment/rock, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Event label, Joides Resolution, Labrador Sea, Leg105, North Atlantic Ocean, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, Overburden pressure, Preconsolidation pressure, Ratio, Sample comment, Shear strength, primary</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1989-09-28</date></data>
