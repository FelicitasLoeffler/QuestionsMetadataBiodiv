The two sets of data at 10Be levels of 109-1010 atoms/g agree within the absolute errors of the two methods. The detection limit for 10Be by the accelerator mass spectrometry is about five orders of magnitude lower than that with the beta counting method.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Alpha spectrometry, ANTIPODE, ANTP04MV-058D, ANTP-058D, ARIES, ARIES-039D, Beryllium 10, Beryllium 10, decay-corrected, Beryllium 10, decay-corrected, standard deviation, Beryllium 10, standard deviation, Beryllium 10/Beryllium 9, Beryllium 10/Beryllium 9, standard deviation, Counting, foraminifera, planktic, Deposit type, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Description, DISTANCE, Distance, maximum, Distance, minimum, Dredge, DRG, Event label, Identification, Melville, NOAA and MMS Marine Minerals Geochemical Database, NOAA-MMS, Pacific Ocean, Thomas Washington, Western Pacific Ocean</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1983-05-11</date></data>
