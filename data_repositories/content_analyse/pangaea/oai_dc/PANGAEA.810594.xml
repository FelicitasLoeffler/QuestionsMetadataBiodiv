In the Southern Hemisphere, seven populations are recognized by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).In this study, we report the movements of seven whales satellite-tagged in the Cook Islands, including the first documented migration to an antarctic feeding ground. In September 2006 and 2007 we attached Argos satellite-monitored tags to eight humpback whales of various sex and behavioral classes. All whales were tagged in the nearshore waters of Rarotonga (the largest island in the Cooks group).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ARGOS Location-only transmitter SPOT 5, BIO, Biology, Comment, Cook Islands, DATE/TIME, Duration, number of days, Event label, Humpback_06/07, Identification, International Polar Year (2007-2008), IPY, Number, Percentage, Sex</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2010-04-23</date></data>
