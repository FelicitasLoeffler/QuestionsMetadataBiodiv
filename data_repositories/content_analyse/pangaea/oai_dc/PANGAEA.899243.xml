However, in addition to positive effects on natural enemies, introducing this resources in an agricultural cropping system can benefit insect pests. The aim of this study was to get knowledge on flower resources as well as individual sugars utilization by one important lepidopteran olive pest, the olive moth, Prays oleae. Fifteen wild flowering plants from the olive grove ecosystem, candidates for conservation biological control, as well as four sugars present in floral nectar were evaluated with respect to their effect on P. oleae key biological parameters (i.e. longevity, length of pre-oviposition and oviposition periods, fertility and fecundity) in each of the three insect generations. It was found that either glucose and fructose increased longevity of P. oleae females, but in particular glucose extended the insect oviposition period as well as fecundity. Although, only a few tested plants increased reproductive parameters of the insect individuals compared to the water-feed controls.  Despite this fact, resident cover crops may be regarded as a valuable habitat manipulation resource for controlling P. oleae within the framework of pest management programs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>conservation biological control, flowering plants, food resources, longevity, Praydidae, sugar feeding</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-03-12</date></data>
