They provide information on alteration processes related to burial diagenesis. The zonal distribution of secondary volcanic products emphasizes a major diagenetic change, characterized by the complete replacement of volcanic glass by an authigenic smectite-phillipsite assemblage, in tephra layers dated at 3.5-4 Ma. This diagenetic "event" occurs simultaneously in the two basins, and, on the basis of isotopic data, under low-temperature conditions. It is independent of distinct sedimentation rates and related to a relative quiescence of on-land volcanic activity. This period suggests a more uniform paleooceanographic situation having tectonic significance, and probably reflects a kinetic and environmental control of diagenetic reactions.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>124-767B, 124-768A, 124-768B, 124-769, 124-769B, COMPCORE, Composite Core, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Leg124, Mindanao Sea, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP, Sulu Sea</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1991-06-30</date></data>
