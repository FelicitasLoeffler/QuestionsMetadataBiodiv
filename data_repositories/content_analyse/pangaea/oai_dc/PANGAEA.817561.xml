These sediments contain, on the average, 1% to 2% total organic carbon (TOC), with a maximum of 4.8%. Their organic facies and richness reflect (1) the small land area of Guatemala, which contributes small amounts of higher land plant remains, and (2) high levels of marine productivity and regionally low levels of dissolved oxygen, which encourage deposition and preservation of marine organic remains. These sediments have good potential for oil but are now immature. For this reason, gaseous hydrocarbons like the ethane identified in the deep parts of the section, as at Sites 496 and 497, are probably migrating from a mature section at depth. The pelagic sediments of the downgoing Cocos Plate are lean in organic carbon and have no petroleum potential</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>67-494A, 67-495, 67-496, 67-497, 67-499, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg67, North Pacific/SLOPE, North Pacific/TRENCH</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1982-08-02</date></data>
