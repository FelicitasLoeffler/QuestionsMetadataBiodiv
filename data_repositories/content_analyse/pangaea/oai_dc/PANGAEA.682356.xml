Six zones and 7 subzones are proposed, and correlation with high-latitude diatoms zonations for the North Pacific, the Norwegian Sea, and the Southern Ocean is suggested by the discovery of selected diatoms in these tropical sediments which were previously thought to be restricted to high latitudes. Six new species and one new variety of diatoms which are stratigraphically useful are proposed : Actinocyclus hajosiae, n. sp., A. radionovae, n. sp., Coscinodiscus blysmos, n. sp., C. praenodulifer, n. sp., Craspedodiscus rydei, n. sp., Thalassiosira bukryi, n. sp., and Coscinodiscus lewisianus var. robustus n. var.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>67-495, 8-71, 9-77B, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg67, Leg8, Leg9, North Pacific/HILL, North Pacific/PLAIN, North Pacific/TRENCH</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1983-02-15</date></data>
