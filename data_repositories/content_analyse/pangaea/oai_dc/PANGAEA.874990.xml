Per plot 5 cores of 15 cm depth were taken, pooled and sieved. From the extracted DNA the 16S and 18S rRNA gene was amplified with primer sets 515f/806r and FR 1/FF390. The samples were subjected to Roche 454 automated sequencer and GS FLX system using titanium chemistry (Macrogen Seoul, Korea). The 16S dataset includes bacterial and archaeal sequences, the 18S dataset includes mainly fungal and protist sequences.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>JenExp, The Jena Experiment</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2017-05-03</date></data>
