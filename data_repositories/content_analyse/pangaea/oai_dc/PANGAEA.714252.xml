Oxygen isotope measurements of benthic foraminifera show a delta18O shift of + 1 per mil  during deposition of this subunit, probably a combined effect of a drop in bottom water temperature and a rise in seawater delta18O. The chronology of this sedimentological and O isotope transition is, however, poorly constrained by fossil evidence.Rb-Sr dating of glauconitic pellets indicates that the lower part of the glauconitic subunit was deposited 11.6 +/- 0.2 Ma ago. Further geochronological evidence, derived from the Sr and C isotopic compositions of foraminifera compared with known seawater-time variations, indicates that the lower pelagic clays are early to middle Miocene, deposited at a mean rate of ~15 m/Ma. The glauconitic subunit contains part of the middle Miocene and probably all of the late Miocene in a condensed sequence with a very low mean depositional rate (~0.2 m/Ma). The overlying glacial marine sediments are probably Pliocene, with a high mean rate of deposition, ~45 m/Ma. This is the first application of C, O and Sr isotopic stratigraphy combined with Rb-Sr dating of glauconitic minerals, and it illustrates the applications of this integrated approach in geochronology.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>38-341, Deep Sea Drilling Project, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, DSDP, Glomar Challenger, Leg38, North Atlantic/Norwegian Sea</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1986-03-30</date></data>
