Although hydrographic properties of the surface SPNA vary on interannual to multidecadal timescales, hydrographic time series scarcely extend back beyond the 1950s. We present a 230 year long record of SPNA surface conditions reconstructed from a very high accumulation rate core that also registers changes in deep flow speed in the Iceland Basin. A lagged correlation is observed between the records of deep flow speed and stable oxygen isotopic composition of the surface SPNA (&#948;18Ow), with strongest correlation when the paleoflow speed record leads by 15&#8211;20 years. This offset may to some extent reflect size&#8208;selective biological mixing of the sediment. Nonetheless, these records reveal a decadal&#8208;scale coupling between surface and deep ocean variability over the past 230 years, possibly driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation, with implications for North Atlantic circulation and climate.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Age, AGE, BC, Box corer, CD159, Charles Darwin, DEPTH, sediment/rock, Gardar Drift, Globigerina bulloides, &#948;18O, RAPiD-21-12B, Sea surface temperature, Size fraction 250&#8211;315 &#956;m, SST from Mg/Ca ratios</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-03-18</date></data>
