The dinocyst assemblages suggest that surface-water masses were cool-temperate to subarctic during most of the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The occurrence of a few warm-temperate indicators, notably Impagidinium species and Polyspaeridium zoharyi, suggests almost continuous northward advection of warm North Atlantic Drift into the Labrador Sea. A major decrease in dinocyst diversity and abundance marks the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene interval. The abundance of acritarchs in Pliocene sediments off southwest Greenland suggests high productivity, which may reflect nutrient flux from the shelf or upwelling, productivity appears to have been much lower at the central Labrador Sea site. Pollen and spore concentrations also decrease from the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene. This diminution probably reflects the impoverishment of vegetation and southward migration of the eastern Canadian tree line at the onset of climatic cooling and glaciation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>105-646B, 105-647A, DRILL, Drilling/drill rig, Joides Resolution, Labrador Sea, Leg105, North Atlantic Ocean, Ocean Drilling Program, ODP</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1989-08-30</date></data>
