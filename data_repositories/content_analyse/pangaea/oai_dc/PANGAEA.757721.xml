Bays of various types in the Kandalaksha Gulf and the Onega Gulf were investigated. Concentration of C_org ranged from 3.5 to 9 mg/l. The highest weighted-mean concentration of C_org occurred in shallow bays of the Onega Gulf (Suma Bay - 6.17 mg/l, Kolezhma Bay - 5.25 mg/1), slightly lower levels occurred in the Soroka Bay (4.85 mg/l) and Kem' Bay (4.78 mg/l). The lowest concentrations were in deep bays of the Kandalaksha Gulf (Chupa Bay - 4.35 mg/l, Velikaya Salma Bay - 4.10 mg/l). As a rule C_org concentration decreases with depth in deep-water bays (but increases slightly in the thermocline layer). The key factor governing organic matter concentration in the bays of the Onega Gulf with river runoff is allochthonous terrigenous organic matter, as indicated by negative correlation of C_org with salinity (R=-0.83+/-0.07, p=0.96) and nonsignificant correlation with primary production.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD, MULT, Multiple investigations, MV-CB-1, MV-CB-2, MV-CB-3, MV-CB-4, MV-KeB-1, MV-KeB-2, MV-KoB-1, MV-KoB-2, MV-KoB-3, MV-PB-1, MV-PB-2, MV-SoB-1, MV-SoB-2, MV-SuB-1, MV-SuB-2, MV-SuB-3, MV-VSB-1, MV-VSB-2, MV-VSB-3, MV-VSB-4, MV-VSB-5, White Sea, Chupa Bay, White Sea, Kem Bay, White Sea, Kolezhma Bay, White Sea, Pongoma Bay, White Sea, Soroka Bay, White Sea, Suma Bay, White Sea, Velikaya Salma Bay</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>1990-02-24</date></data>
