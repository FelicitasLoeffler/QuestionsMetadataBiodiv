Laboratory and field studies have indicated that single-strain nitrogen-fixing (diazotrophic) cyanobacteria from the Baltic Sea are sensitive to ocean acidification and warming, 2 drivers of marked future change in the marine environment. Here, we enclosed a natural plankton community in 12 indoor mesocosms (volume ~1400 l) and manipulated partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( pCO2) in seawater to yield 6 CO2 treatments with 2 different temperature treatments (16.6&#176;C and 22.4&#176;C, pCO2 range = 360-2030 &#181;atm). We followed the filamentous, heterocystous diazotrophic cyanobacteria community (Nostocales, primarily Nodularia spumigena) over 4 wk. Our results indicate that heterocystous diazotrophic cyanobacteria may become less competitive in natural plankton communities under ocean acidification. Elevated CO2 had a negative impact on Nodularia sp. biomass, which was exacerbated by warming. Our results imply that Nodularia sp. may contribute less to new nitrogen inputs in the Baltic Sea in the future.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>BIOACID, Biological Impacts of Ocean Acidification, DATE/TIME, Day of experiment, Dolichospermum spp., biomass, Mesocosm label, Nodularia spp., biomass, Nostoc sp., biomass as carbon, Phase, Phosphate, Phosphate, organic, dissolved, Phytoplankton, biomass, Ratio, Sample code/label, Treatment: temperature, &#948;15N</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2018-04-27</date></data>
