The area is underlain by continuous permafrost. Vegetation types were distinguished based on vegetation height derived from airborne laserscanning, airborne orthophotos and observations from the field site. A detailed description of the data sources and processing steps is included.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Classification, geo.X, Geotiff, Modular Observation Solutions for Earth Systems, MOSES, MULT, Multiple investigations, Northwest Territories, Canada, PermaSAR, PermaSAR: Development of a Method to Detect Subsidence by Means of D-InSAR in Permafrost Regions, Python, Qgis, raster, The Research Network for Geosciences in Berlin and Potsdam, Trail_Valley_Creek</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2019-07-24</date></data>
