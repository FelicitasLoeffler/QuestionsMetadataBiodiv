It was established that, in addition to Fe and Mn, a limited number of major and trace elements (P, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mo, Co, Zn, Ni, As, Pb, Sb, Tl, U, W, Y, and Ga) is accumulated with variable degree of intensity (relative to sediments) in the nodules. The maximal content of Mn in the nodules is 100 times higher than in the host sediments, whereas for all other elements listed above these ratios vary from more than one to 10-20. Manganese and, to a lesser extent, Ba and Sr are concentrated in the buried concretions. Other elements are primarily concentrated in concretions exposed on the sea floor. The occurrence mode of the concretions and compositional data on interstitial water suggest that metals in the concretions derive from seawater and suspended particulates, in addition to sediments. Burial of concretions in the sediment pile is accompanied by alteration of their composition, accumulation of Mn (relative to Fe), and loss of several associated metals.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Archive of Ocean Data, ARCOD</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date>2009-07-13</date></data>
