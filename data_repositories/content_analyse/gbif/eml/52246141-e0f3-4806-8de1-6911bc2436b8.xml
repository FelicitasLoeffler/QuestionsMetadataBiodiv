The database includes records from site and species surveys by staff and local naturalists, extractions of records from literature, records from other organisations which hold records for Dorset, and records sent in by the general public.  The data quality is therefore variable but all records have been through a basic validation process by local experts before entry.   This dataset covers only the species selected for development of species inventories within the SW Pilot.
