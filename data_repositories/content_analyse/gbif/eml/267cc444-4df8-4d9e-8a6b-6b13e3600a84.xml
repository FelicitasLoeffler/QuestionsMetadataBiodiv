This list represents 39 coleopteran species recorded within the boundaries of the Mixed Forest habitat near the Gede Forest Station both inside and outside of the electric elephant fence. Specimens were collected in April and May, 2009 using pitfall and malaise traps. They were identified to the most specific taxon rank possible at the National Museums of Kenya. Of particular note are Crepidogaster hubenthali (Carabidae) and Cryptochile elegans (Tenebrionidae) which are considered endemic to the Kenyan coastal forests.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-01</date></data>
