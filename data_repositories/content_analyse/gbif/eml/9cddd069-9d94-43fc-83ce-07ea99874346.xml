In the downstream part of the Oir River, a trapping system controls eel migration (a descent trap since 1984 for silver eels that descend and more recently, in 2017 an upstream trap for yellow eels). On this occasion, biometric characteristics are developed to characterize the population in order to feed this data set....</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-06</date></data>
