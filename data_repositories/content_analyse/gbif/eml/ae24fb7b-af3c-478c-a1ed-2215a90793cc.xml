Bean Life Science Museum at Brigham Young University. It totals approximately 2,000,000 specimens, mostly insects. Although worldwide in coverage, an emphasis is on western North America. Although taxonomically diverse, strengths include Coleoptera, Plecoptera, and Siphonaptera. The insect tissue holdings are outstanding. The principal aim is systematic study, but the collection is available to a wide variety of researchers.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-01</date></data>
