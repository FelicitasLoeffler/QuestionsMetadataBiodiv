The aim of the study was to assess the colonization patterns of Harpacticoida according to different sediment conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sampling of experimental and control plots consisted of 30 samples with three subsamples each taken by syringe corer 1'8 cm2. The surveyed reas were located in the mid-littoral zone of a relatively homogeneous slightly silty sandflat.
