Likewise, the majority of Continental Patagonian (CP) lakes, rivers and other water bodies remain as pristine as microbiologically unstudied. This project constitutes an initiative aimed to contribute to surveying, systematizing and understanding the dynamics (i.e. ecology and evolution) of microbial communities from this region.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-16</date></data>
