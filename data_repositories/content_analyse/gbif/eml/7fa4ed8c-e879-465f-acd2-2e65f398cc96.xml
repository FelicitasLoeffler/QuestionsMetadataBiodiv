Specifically, to develop data collection tool to capture the required data, inventory of REDD+ data holders and the type of data they hold, convene IPT-training workshop for holders of biodiversity data from REDD+ project to enhance publishing. A total of 13 tree datasets in major vegetation types were mobilized and developed into Darwin Core Archives ready for publishing. The species richness in the different vegetation types were miombo woodlands (149), mangrove forests (4), Acacia-Commiphora woodlands (156), Costal forests (33), evergreen forests on Volcanic mountains (142), evergreen forests on crystalline mountains (56). The tree species richness in these biomes is appreciably high with potential for economic development through sustainable management.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-04-09</date></data>
