The program was started in the Yuganskiy Nature Reserve in 1988 and will be continued in the future. Different protocols of inventory and quantitative monitoring are used for different biodiversity groups, e.g. winter tracks counts, bird census, geobotanical releves, and others. They will be described in details in the future update of the dataset. Present dataset represents species lists of Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia and Amphibia, registered in the Nature Reserve from 1988 to 2018. The data on population status (occurrenceStatus) and habitat condition (occurrenceRemarks) averaged for the entire observation period are provided in the Extension.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-02-28</date></data>
