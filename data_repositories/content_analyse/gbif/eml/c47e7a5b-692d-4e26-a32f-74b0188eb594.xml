Species data were collected from all taxonomic bibliography available at the World Spider Catalog 2018 and complemented by data in other publications found through Google Scholar or other sources (https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org, https://login.webofknowledge.com, http://srs.britishspiders.org.uk, http://symbiota4.acis.ufl.edu/scan/portal, https://lepus.unine.ch, http://www.tuite.nl/iwg/Araneae/SpiBenelux/?species, https://atlas.arages.de, https://arachnology.cz/rad/araneae-1.html, http://biodiversityresearch.org/research/biogeography/iberia/).These data were used in assessing the global threat status of spider species worldwide. This will serve as the basis for a future Sampled Red List Index (SRLI) for spiders. SRLI are typically employed to assess the conservation priorities and trends of large organismal groups, and are thus suited for assessing the conservation trends of large taxa as a whole.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-05-13</date></data>
