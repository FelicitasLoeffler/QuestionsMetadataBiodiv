<data><id>9ff7d317-609b-4c08-bd86-3bc404b77c42</id><eml:eml/dataset/title>Manual of the Alien Plants of Belgium</eml:eml/dataset/title><eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para>&lt;p&gt;The Manual of the Alien Plants of Belgium is a species checklist dataset published by the Botanic Garden Meise. It contains information on all (over 2.500) non-native vascular plants occurring in the wild in Belgium since 1800. The checklist is almost entirely based on a thorough herbarium revision of the main public Belgian herbaria (Verloove 2006), actively maintained, and updated regularly at Verloove (2018, http://alienplantsbelgium.be). Here it is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each species: the scientific name, kingdom, family, stable taxon identifier, and IPNI (2018) scientific name ID where available (in the taxon core), the presence in Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels Capital Region, as well as the year of the first introduction (first collection) and last assessment/observation in Belgium (given as a year range in the event date in the distribution extension), coarse habitat information (in the species profile extension), and the pathway(s) of introduction, native range(s) and invasion stage in Belgium (in the description extension). The dataset can be used for researching and managing alien plants or compiling regional and national registries of alien species. Issues with the dataset can be reported at https://github.com/trias-project/alien-plants-belgium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have released this dataset to the public domain under a Creative Commons Zero waiver. We would appreciate it if you follow the GBIF citation guidelines (https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines) when using the data.

It is selected as one of the authoritative sources for the compilation of a unified and reproducible checklist of alien species in Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-03-19</date></data>
