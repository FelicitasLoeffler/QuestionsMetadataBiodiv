The program was initiated to describe the quantitative and qualitative structure and spatial variation of the community of macromycetes and to show its dynamics seasonally and inter-annually. Ten plots were located in different forest types and visited regularly during vegetation seasons 2015-2018. The results of plot-based counts were published in a separate dataset (https://doi.org/10.15468/ge1hkl). Plot-based observations were supplemented by route-based surveys to reveal rare species and enlarge observation area. Totally five routes each about 1 km long were located in proximity of plots in major vegetation types and visited regularly through vegetation season. The resulting dataset represents the data of 73 route-based surveys, made over the vegetation seasons 2015-2018, corresponding to 2093 occurrences with counts of fruit bodies of the observed species.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-08-14</date></data>
