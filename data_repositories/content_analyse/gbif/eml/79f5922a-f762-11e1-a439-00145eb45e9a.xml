The majority proved to be palynologically barren. Twenty-one species and subspecies of dinoflagellate cysts were recorded, however, from the eight samples that proved productive. The irregular distribution of the cysts makes accurate age determinations difficult, particularly for the lower part of the succession. However, species recovered from Cores 119-738C-21R to 119-738C-23R indicate a latest Maastrichtian age.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1991-01-01</date></data>
