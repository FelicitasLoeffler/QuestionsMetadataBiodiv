Preliminary culture experiments furnished information on life span, salinity tolerances and population density of species. Reproduction processes (probably asexual) could be observed several times. A possible carbonate production of ca. 150 g/year/m**2 has been estimated.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1971-01-01</date></data>
