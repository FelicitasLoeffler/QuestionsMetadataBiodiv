The data is mostly used to answer questions concerning environmental planning and nature legislation (the Flora and Fauna Act and the Nature Conservation Act).The provincial department has been collecting comprehensive data about flora since 1975, and collecting data about fauna with sample surveys since 1988. Since 2005, a new method has been applied to flora and fauna surveys. This method aims to comprehensively survey flora and fauna as much as possible. It maps a selection of species called the &#8216;mapping species&#8217;. These species are selected for their indicative value, rareness and protected status. Vegetation species are not mapped, although forest biotopes are rated for quality.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.535,461 records (March 2018)https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/12-206-vlakdekkende-flora-en-faunakartering-provincie-utrecht/</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-03-22</date></data>
