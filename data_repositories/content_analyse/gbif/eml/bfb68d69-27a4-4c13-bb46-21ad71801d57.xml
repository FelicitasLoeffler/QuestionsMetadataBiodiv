A total of 12 roosts were identified, which included six limestone caves, two tree roosts and four man-made structures (mainly buildings). A total of 13 bat species were recorded to roost in these roosts, with two limestone caves hosting at least more than five species. Only one cave found inside ASF was legally protected, the others were not legally protected because they occurred outside ASF in privately owned individual farms, and were highly prone to demolition and destruction. Two roosts occurred in the middle of rapidly expanding urban areas and were most likely be destroyed in the near future. This information can be used for monitoring the population of bats in these roosts and the conservation status of the bat roosts.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-03-16</date></data>
