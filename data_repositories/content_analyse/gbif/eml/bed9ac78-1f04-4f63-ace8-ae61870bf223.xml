Pouting was captured using bottom trawl and gillnets, at the North East Atlantic Coast, between Figueira da Foz and Cabo da Roca. Pathological findings, microscopic and ultrastructural characteristics, egg features, host-parasite interaction at muscle level and a new host on a new geographic area, all suggest that a new species is involved.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2016-11-14</date></data>
