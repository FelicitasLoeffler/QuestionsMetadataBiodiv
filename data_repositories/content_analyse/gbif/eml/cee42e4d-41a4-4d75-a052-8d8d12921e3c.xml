Diversity data from all three domains of life were collected via next-generation DNA sequencing and numerous geochemical and nutrient data were also collected, which greatly contributes to the existing understanding of benthic Antarctic sediments communities.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-09-07</date></data>
