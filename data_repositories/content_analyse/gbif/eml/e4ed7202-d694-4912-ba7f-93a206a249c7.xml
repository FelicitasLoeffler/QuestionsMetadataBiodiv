These data are found in different museums and herbaria and are reflected in literature data from different countries and researchers. Some data are already digitized and organized in databases, but most of the data are disaggregated and presented in different formats (Ivanova, Shashkov, 2017, Filippova et al., 2017). A central national biodiversity system is missing. The majority of Russian botanical and zoological collections are not digitized.Our local source includes metadata about biological collections, archives, digital biodiversity databases and data holders contacts. Also we summarized literature sources about Russian biodiversity databases from 1993 until now (http://gbif.ru/ruspublic). Our source will be updated.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-09-12</date></data>
