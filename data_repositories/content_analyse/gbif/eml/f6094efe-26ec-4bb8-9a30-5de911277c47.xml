A total of 23 vascular plant species surveys were carried out in three sites: one for each semester in Paul da Praia da Vit&#243;ria (PPV) and Paul da Pedreira do Cabo da Praia (PPCP), one for each semester (except in 2014) in Paul do Belo Jardim (PBJ). Main objectives were to determine the plant richness of the three sites and monitor seasonal and between year variation on species composition.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-20</date></data>
