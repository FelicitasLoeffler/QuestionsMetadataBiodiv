Each foray was led by a seasoned member of NJMA. At each foray, fungal fruit bodies were observed and collected by ca. 20-30 attendees. Collecting took place during the course of two hours on land within a ca. 1-mile radius from the starting point (see latitude and longitude for each foray location). Species were identified immediately using field guides, other printed works, and various online resources. We acknoledge the participation of all citizens who joined the forays during this year.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-03</date></data>
