The inventory was carried out by the Research Group "Ecology and Natural Resource Management of Savannas and Forests of Roraima", linked to the National Institute for Research in Amazonia (INPA) in December / 2017. The survey was based on 129 permanent plots dispersed in six trails that cross the research grid. Measurements of stem diameter (DBH = diameter at the breast height) of each observed individual (palms and trees) were taken. All floristic data were correlated with the dominant forest types of the sampled area.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-14</date></data>
