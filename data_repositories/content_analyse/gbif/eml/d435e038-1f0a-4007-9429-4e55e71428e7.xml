The survey was organized by ConDidact (Danish private company with several websites used for teaching pupils about e.g. Danish animals, www.danske-dyr.dk). The participants searched for 4 species of spiders:  &#8226;	Araneus diadematus (Garden Cross Spider, Danish: Korsedderkop)&#8226;	Araneus quadratus (Four Spot Orb Weaver, Danish: Kvadratedderkop)&#8226;	Argiope bruennichi (Orb-weaving Spider, Danish: Hvepseedderkop)&#8226;	Pholcus phalangioides (Long-bodied Cellar Spider, Danish: Mejeredderkop)The project invited the public to search for specific species in their local area. Species descriptions, instructions etc. were made available on a project website (http://danske-dyr.dk/Sv%C3%A6r/naturjagter/Den%20store%20Edderkoppejagt%202011/). Observations of species could be submitted through an online form. The species observations were documented by digital photos, and later were validated by scientific experts.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2015-12-01</date></data>
