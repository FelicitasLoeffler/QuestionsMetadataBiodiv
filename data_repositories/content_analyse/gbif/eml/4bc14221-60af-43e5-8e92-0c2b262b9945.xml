It represents one of the largest co-ordinated programmes of such work on reedbed wetlands for over a decade.  The project aims to generate a better understanding of the requirements of a wider range of reedbed wildlife.  This enhanced understanding will be used to inform advice, training, management and future conservation strategies across England's reedbeds.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Water traps for aerial invertebrates, pitfall traps for ground-dwelling invertebrates, light traps for Lepidoptera and aquatic netting for aquatic invertebrates were carried out at 3 reedbed sites: Norfolk Wildlife Trust NNR Hickling Broad (Norfolk), Natural England NNR Stodmarsh (Kent), and RSPB NNR Ham Wall (Somerset).   Water trap, pitfall trap and aquatic netting surveys were undertaken between June and August 2009.  Light trapping for moths was done between June and August 2010.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The project was led by RSPB with 50% funding from Natural England via the Countdown 2010 Biodiversity Action Fund and working in partnership with other partners such as Wildlife Trusts, The National Trust, Buglife, independent ecological contractors, Butterfly Conservation.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
