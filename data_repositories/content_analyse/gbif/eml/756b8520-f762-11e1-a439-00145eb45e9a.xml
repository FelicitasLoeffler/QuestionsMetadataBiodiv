All specimens were collected from the Nankai Trough (Sites 582 and 583) in Pleistocene sediments from 21.56 to 110.38 m sub-bottom (4618 to 4879 m water depth). Ostracodes were not found at Site 584 (Japan Trench). All species are warm-temperate, shallow-water inhabitants, suggesting that the sediments containing them are slump deposits.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1986-01-01</date></data>
