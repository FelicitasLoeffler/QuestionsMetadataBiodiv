The monitoring program falls under the monitoring program of the state of water management (MWTL) and aims to make sound statistical judgements about the flora quality and environmental quality of ecosystems of the banks of the various national waters.This monitoring program encompasses a selection of over 400 square kilometre plots along the national waters. It only focuses on the flora of the banks: the area between the stream bed and the top of the outermost dyke. The bank zone of the selected square kilometre plots are examined for all occurring plant species every 4 years. The occurrence as well as the abundance is recorded for a number of these species. Also the occurrence of local Red List species is reported in detail.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.278,824 records (March 2018)https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/12-201-meetnet-oevers-zoete-rijkswateren-floron/</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-03-22</date></data>
