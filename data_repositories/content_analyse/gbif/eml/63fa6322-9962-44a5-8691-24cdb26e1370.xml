Data compiled for the Departments of Environmental Protection and Conservation and Land Management.This dataset derives from a database that has been compiled and maintained over many years. It combines the results of a number of floristic studies conducted on plant communities of the IBRA Swan Coastal Plain Bioregion (abbreviated as SWA, SEWPC 2012) south of the Moore River, hereafter referred to as the southern Swan Coastal Plain. It includes sampling site details, the flora collected at these sampling sites and the floristic community type assigned to these sampling sites. The taxonomy of the flora in the database has been updated regularly as determined by Greg and Bronwen Keighery. This dataset lists the taxonomy (including family names) which was current in this database on 23 June 2005 when this dataset was compiled.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2013-08-16</date></data>
