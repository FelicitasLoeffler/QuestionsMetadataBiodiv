Sixty logs were surveyed for fruitbodies in each of the ten Norwegian study localities.Fruitbody specimens were identified by Viacheslav Spirin, Matti Kulju, Sergio P&#233;rez Gorj&#243;n, Sten Svantesson and Jenni Nord&#233;n. The identification work was supervised by Karl-Henrik Larsson who also checked all the specimens that represent taxa challenging to identify.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-01-25</date></data>
