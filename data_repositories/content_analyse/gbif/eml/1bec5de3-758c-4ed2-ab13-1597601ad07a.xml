The bulk of the collection dates from the 1960's and up to today.Todays collection covers most of the major groups of invertebrates with lepidoptera, coleoptera, diptera and hymenoptera as the largest parts of the collections (approximately 40 %, 20 %, 10 % and 7 % respectively in 2017). The most active part of the collection today is the diptera collection. Some groups are overrepresented compared to others. This reflects the taxonomic expertise among the staff since the first regular employee in the 1840's and donations of private collections.The geographic coverage of the objects in this collection is mainly Norwegian mainland and Svalbard. In addition the collection includes objects from all other continents except the Antarctica. Within mainland Norway the majority of objects collected origins from central parts of Norway. Examples from other parts of the world are chironomids from America, Africa, Europe and Asia, a historic circumpolar collection of coleopteran, lepidoptera from Malawi and terrestrial molluscs from Madeira, Cuba and some other countries.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-12</date></data>
