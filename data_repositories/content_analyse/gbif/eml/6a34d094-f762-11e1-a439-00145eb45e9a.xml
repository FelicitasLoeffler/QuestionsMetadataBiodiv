A clearly distinguishable distribution pattern was observed in relation to the water masses and fronts of the ACC. The dinoflagellate cysts of species characteristic of open oceanic environments, such as Impagidinium species, are highly abundant around the Subtropical Front, whereas south of this front, cosmopolitan species such as Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and the cysts of Protoceratium reticulatum characterise the transition from subtropical to subantarctic surface waters. The subantarctic surface waters are dominated by the cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates, such as Protoperidinium spp. and Selenopemphix antarctica. The cysts of Protoperidinium spp. form the dominant part of the assemblages around the Antarctic Polar Front, whereas S. antarctica concentrations increase further to the south. The presence of S. antarctica in sediments of the Maud Rise, a region of seasonal sea-ice cover, reflects its tolerance for low temperatures and sea-ice cover. A previously undescribed species, Cryodinium meridianum gen. nov. sp. nov., has a restricted distribution pattern between the Antarctic Polar Front and the ACC-Weddell Gyre Boundary.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2002-01-01</date></data>
