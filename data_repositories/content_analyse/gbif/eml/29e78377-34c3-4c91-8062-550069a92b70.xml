Over the following decades several dozens of researches have worked in the area and a total of about 150 scientific works have been published. No attempts to summarize the results of previous works and to create a regional checklist have been accomplished before.Fungal Records Database of Yugra (FReDY) was developed to accumulate the results of previous studies published up to date.  The FReDY database includes 22 fields describing species name, publication source, herbarium number, date of sampling, geography, vegetation, substrate, and some other ecological features. Records in the database were collected from previously published works, e.g. results of inventories of fungi in the region. The herbarium specimens or other unpublished records were not included in the database at this stage.Presently, the dataset includes about 12,000 of fungal records in the region and adjacent areas, reported from 77 scientific publications. According to the database summary report, there are about 2,600 species and subspecies taxa identified within KHMAO up-to-date. The richest studied groups are Agaricoid basidiomycetes (30%), Lichens (37%) and Aphyllophoroid basidiomycetes (19%). The less studied groups are Ascomycetes (9%), Myxomycetes (3%), Heterobasidiomycetous fungi, Yeasts and Rusts (&lt;1%).</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-11-12</date></data>
