The autochthonous zeolitic pelagic claystone is characterized by late Campanian abyssal agglutinated foraminifers that allow correlation with the North Atlantic and the adjacent Pigafetta Basin. Assemblages of DendrophryalRhizammina in graded beds within the zeolitic claystone indicate reworking through entrainment in the flocculent E layer of turbidites, rather than recolonization following a biosiliceous event. Background sedimentation of the claystone took place below the carbonate compensation depth.The nannofossil chalk contains reworked lower bathyal to abyssal calcareous foraminifers of late Paleocene to early Miocene age. The topmost bed of the nannofossil chalk unit commences with an algal foraminiferal packstone containing Lepidocyclina sumatrensis, Heterostegina borneensis, Amphistegina hauerina, Asterigerina marshallana, and A. tentoria, which indicate that the source area was a shallow-water reef and allow the bed to be dated as early Miocene. The absence of obviously younger planktonic microfossils in the graded bed indicates that the resedimentation event was generally contemporaneous with original deposition and took place during an early Miocene global sea-level highstand.An early Miocene shallow-water assemblage is also seen in the graded beds at the base of a volcaniclastic turbidite sequence overlying the nannofossil chalks. Resedimentation of this unit was associated with volcanic activity some distance away.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1992-01-01</date></data>
