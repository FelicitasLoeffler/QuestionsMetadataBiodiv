Any non-native species present in a sample were recorded when they were of the target group, for example Signal Crayfish (Pacifastacus lenisculus) in a benthic invertebrate sample or Canadian pondweed (Elodea Canadensis) in a plant survey. Other non-native species are recorded when seen at or around monitoring sites. At the time of surveying between 1970s and 2012, non-native species did not have a specific monitoring programme.  Formally known as AfA 226.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-11-13</date></data>
