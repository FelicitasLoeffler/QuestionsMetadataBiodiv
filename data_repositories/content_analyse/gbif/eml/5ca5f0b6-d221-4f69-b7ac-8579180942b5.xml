Every specimen in the resource is digitized, and the exact storage location of each specimen is tracked in a collection management information system for quick reference and retrieval. The databased information for every voucher is also archived in the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), permitting the permanent storage, validation and analysis of barcode sequence data and associated specimen metadata.As of April 2017, this resource contains specimen information from the following resources:1. Carr, C. M., Hardy, S. M., Brown, T. M., Macdonald, T. A., &amp; Hebert, P. D. N. (2011). A tri-oceanic perspective: DNA barcoding reveals geographic structure and cryptic diversity in Canadian polychaetes. PLoS One, 6(7), e22232.2. Layton, K. K., Martel, A. L., &amp; Hebert, P. D. N.
