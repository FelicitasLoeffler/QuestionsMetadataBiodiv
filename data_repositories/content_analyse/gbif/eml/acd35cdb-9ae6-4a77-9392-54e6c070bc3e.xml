However, the development of common species in these areas can also provide important additional information.We therefore follow all amphibians in areas where key species live, including common varieties. Data about all species is collected during field visits. The monitoring program supplies information about the current state of and changes to amphibian populations in the Netherlands in collaboration with Statistics Netherlands (CBS).Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.Positive observations without zeros.101,808 records (March 2018)NDFF protocol https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/1-201-monitoring-van-amfibieen-in-nederland-2001/</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-03-28</date></data>
