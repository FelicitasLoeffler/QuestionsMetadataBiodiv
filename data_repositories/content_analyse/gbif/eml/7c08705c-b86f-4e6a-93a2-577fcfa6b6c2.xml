We applied bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) using a high-throughput approach to detecting protein synthesis in individual cells, on sediments from deep-sea methane seeps. Sediment samples have been incubated in the presence or absence of methane and a bioorthogonal amino acid. V6 regions of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA genes were amplified using general primers, tagged, and analyzed for shifts in the microbial community during time of incubation.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-09-05</date></data>
