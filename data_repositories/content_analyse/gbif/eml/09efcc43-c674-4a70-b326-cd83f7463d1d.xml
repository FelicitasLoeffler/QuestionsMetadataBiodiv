English translation: &#8220;Occurrence of Invasion Plant Species&#8221;). The occurrence data can be added by any user after a simple registration (citizen science concept) process, however, the data published in GBIF are provided only by professional scientists. The total study area is approximately 19,000 km2. The GBIF resource contains 10894 H.&#160;sosnowskyi occurrence points, each with their geographical coordinates and photographs of the plants in the locus of growth. The research was supported by programs of the Ural Branch of RAS (&#8470; 12-4-009, &#8470; 13-4-028) and by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and Government of Komi Republic (&#8470; 16-44-110694)</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-02-16</date></data>
