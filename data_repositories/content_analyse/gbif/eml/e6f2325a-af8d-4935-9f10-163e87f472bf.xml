The EMD was developed to hold vegetation, bird and other species data gathered by a wide range of surveys. Most (but not all) of these Surveys were designed to monitor habitats and species being targeted for management by agri-environment schemes.  The data has almost all been gathered since 1987 and the main schemes involved comprise  the Environmentally Sensitive Areas, Countryside Stewardship schemes and Environmental Stewardship. The data comprise species records from a wide range of moorland, grassland, wetland and coastal habitats.  As the dataset comprises records from many surveys, designed with specific individual purposes, the distribution of sampling points are a function of those individual surveys rather than representing any systematic coverage within the dataset as a whole. There are no sensitive records in this dataset.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
