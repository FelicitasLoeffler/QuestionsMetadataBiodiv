Originally, the main target species were salmon and trout. Beginning in 2000, eels were monitored in the same way as salmonids. The survey of the entire fish community has been carried out on a network of seven sites. It is usually done in September and October. Two sites are also monitored in May for all species. The data consists of 1738 electrofishing operations and 153068 fish records. Biological traits measured on the fish sampled are sex, maturity status, length, weight and age. Some of the salmon, trout and eels are identified individually with a pit tag. Scale sampling is carried out on a subsample of individuals to estimate the age of the fish. The survey is carried out under the Research Observatory on Diadromous Fish in Coastal Streams (ERO DiaPFC) program. The data are stored in the database of the ERO. They are used to develop predictive models and tools for providing scientific advice to improve the management of these heritage species</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-05</date></data>
