It contains information on 274 sampling events with 162 occurrences of invasive New Zealand pigmyweed starting from 2013. This dataset is a subset of a larger vegetation analysis and focuses only on the Crassula helmsii occurrences. Here the dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each event: a stable eventID, date and location of the observation, and a short description of the sampling protocol (in the event core), supplemented with specific information for each occurrence: a stable occurrenceID, the scientific name and higher classification of the observed species, the number of recorded individuals and a reference to the observer of the record (in the occurrence extension).
