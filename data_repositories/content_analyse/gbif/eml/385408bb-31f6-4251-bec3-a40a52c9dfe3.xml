This is a repeat survey of breeding waders carried out in the early 1990s in order to understand the main factors contributing to the decline of snipe in Britain. The survey was carried out during the 1996 snipe breeding season on key sites throughout Britain. Snipe are a species of conservation concern and have suffered population declines. This survey was carried out by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Natural England.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
