The extraction of DNA from the sediment samples collected from the surface (2 cm) and subsurface (16 cm) layers in two seasons (monsoon and post monsoon) and the direct application of the 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing resulted in approximately 117 Mbp of data from three sampling stations (Jharkhali, Sahidnagar and Godkhali). The taxonomic analysis of the pyrosequencing data grouped the sequences into 24 different phyla. In general, Proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla and further analysis revealed the dominance of Deltaprotaobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria within the sediments. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed analysis of the microbial diversity in the world''s largest mangrove sediment of Sundarabns.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
