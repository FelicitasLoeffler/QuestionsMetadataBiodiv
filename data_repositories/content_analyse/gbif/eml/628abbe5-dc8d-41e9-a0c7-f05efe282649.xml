For this genus, at least, this is certainly the largest collection in North America. The collection is also strong in Calicioids as well as in other microlichen groups characteristic of oldgrowth forests. Taken as a whole, the collection is very strong on epiphytic lichens, and rather strong on terricolous lichens, especially macrolichens.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-05-16</date></data>
