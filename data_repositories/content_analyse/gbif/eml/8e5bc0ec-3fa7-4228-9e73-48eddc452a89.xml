They usually form sandy layers preserved in coastal sediments that may contain indicators of marine origin such as foraminifera microfossils and the geochemical signal of saltwater. Environmental DNA sequencing of marine species targets in a series of up to about 2000 years old sandy paleotsunami deposits is promising to detect ancient tsunami events even in the absence of microfossil and sedimentological evidence.The DNA content of 10 environmental coastal sediment samples was extacted from paleotsunami deposit and peat layers of a core and additional peat and beach sand surface samples taken from a wetland on eastern Hokkaido Island (Japan) facing the Kuril Trench subduction zone generating frequent large tsunamigenic earthquakes. The 37f hypervariable region of the foraminiferal SSU rDNA was PCR amplified and PCR products were pooled in one library for Illumiona MiSeq sequence and diversity analyses.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
