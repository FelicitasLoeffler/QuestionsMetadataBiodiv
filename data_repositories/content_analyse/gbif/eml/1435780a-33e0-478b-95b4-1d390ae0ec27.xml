For example, one collection extensively documents the palynology of 11 of the 17 major coal seams in Oklahoma, many of which are no longer available due to abandonment, flooding and reclamation. Nevertheless, we also have specimens from all 50 states and more than 50 countries. Overall, the collections contain more than 250 type and figured specimens.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-25</date></data>
