It has been organized and operated by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional, international group of paleobiological researchers. Its purpose is to provide global, collection-based occurrence and taxonomic data for organisms of all geological ages, as well data services to allow easy access to data for independent development of analytical tools, visualization software, and applications of all types. The Database&#8217;s broader goal is to encourage and enable data-driven collaborative efforts that address large-scale paleobiological questions.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-11-03</date></data>
