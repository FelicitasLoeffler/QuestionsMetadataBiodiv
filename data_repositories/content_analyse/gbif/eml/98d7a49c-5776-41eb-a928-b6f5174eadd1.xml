The Caatinga represents 11% of Brazilian territory and is in South America the largest and more biodiverse semiarid tropical ecoregion, yet only 5% of its territory is covered by Federal Conservation Units, with scarce collections of flora samples. Thus, for purposes of species distribution, environmental management and conservation, it is necessary a georeferenced inventory of existing collections. The aim of this resource is to gauge, by means of geographic coordinates correction and recovery of the flora specimens present in the RB Herbarium, the amount of collects performed in the Federal Conservation Units belonging to the Caatinga domain.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-27</date></data>
