Almost 30 years ago bird records were collected across Kenya that resulted in the book, A Bird Atlas of Kenya, that mapped and described the status of all the 1,065 species of birds then recorded in the country. Since then much has changed in terms of habitats and climatic conditions in Kenya and as a result the distributions and status of many of our birds have also dramatically changed &#8211; but we don&#8217;t know how or to what extent!The Kenya Bird Map project aims to map the current distribution of all of Kenya&#8217;s bird species and describe their status with the help of valued input from Citizen Scientists &#8211; volunteer members of the public who are keen to contribute through going birding and submitting their observations to the project. By pooling the efforts of many Citizen Scientist birders, Kenya Bird Map will tell the story of changing bird distributions and abundance - and in so doing provide a powerful tool for conservation</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-28</date></data>
