Field data from professor Antoine Cleef (derived from his PhD thesis on paramo vegetation in the eastern cordillera (1981), the ECOANDES project and independent field trips), the data wascollected in four field campaigns in 1977, 1983, 1984 and 1989. 2.A study on Andean Paramo's ecology by H. Sturm and O. Rangel done in 1985.3.A study on the phytosociological analysis of paramo vegetation by R. Sanchez and O. Rangel in 1990.4. A study about the influence of potato cultivation in the paramo vegetatation by W. Ferwerda in 1987. 5. A study of limit vegetation ecology done by M.L. Becking and J.j. Smeets in 1989 part of the ECOANDES project.6. A study on the description of paramo vegetation by R. Bekker and A. Cleef in 1985.All studies provide information on the occurrence and location of 7868 plant species from the Paramo in this area.  For the purpose of the GBIF data-publishing, vegetation releve data were converted into species occurrence data.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-06-18</date></data>
