Carlos I</eml:eml/dataset/title><eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para>The collection of the Museu Oceanogr&#225;fico D. Carlos I is a historical specimen, instrument and document collection that has been housed in the Aqu&#225;rio Vasco da Gama since 1935. The collection was the result of several scientific campaigns conducted by D. Carlos I, widely considered to be the father of modern Portuguese oceanography, from 1896 to 1907. The ichthyological collection is made up of 675 surviving catalogue records of specimens caught and acquired by, or offered to, D. Carlos I from 1892 to 1907, and includes the type specimen for Odontaspis nasutus Bragan&#231;a, 1904 (junior synonym of Mitsukurina owstoni Jordan, 1898), along with several specimens of deep sea species. All specimens were caught in coastal Portuguese waters, and were preserved in alcohol, formalin, or dried.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-01-29</date></data>
