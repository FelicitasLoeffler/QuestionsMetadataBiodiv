The data is mostly used to answer environmental planning questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mapping project prioritises areas outside of the National Ecological Network (NEN). The provincial department has collected full area data about the occurrence of flora and vegetation on and off since 1983.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rural area of the province has been mapped at least every 11 years since 2001. Full area mapping looks at both plant species and vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The occurrence of about 350 plant species is currently being mapped. The mapping methods are selected for their indicative value and/or the rare occurrence of the species. Since the first mapping project (data up to 1996), the list has been expanded with about 150 species. The third project started in 2006. Only highly valuable vegetation types and vegetation protected by the Habitats Directive are mapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive observations without zeros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;262,816 records (March 2018)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/12-008-vlakdekkende-kartering-flora-provincie-noord-brabant/&lt;/p&gt;</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-05-01</date></data>
