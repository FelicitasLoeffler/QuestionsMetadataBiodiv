The bacterial biogeographic pattern in marine sediments can reflect the time variation and biological processes of the local ecological environment quickly and accurately. In this study, we collected sediment samples of the two seasons of winter and summer in coastal area of East China Sea at 7 stations from the near to the distant for investigating bacterial community with 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-08-31</date></data>
