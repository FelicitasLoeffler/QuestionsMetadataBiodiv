During the rapid survey, a total of 1,522 field signs and six beaver sightings were recorded. The survey results were combined with long-term observations of beaver activity recorded over several years to establish the population size, distribution and impacts of the beavers.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
