The group was once considered quite rare, but the application of appropriate techniques for its capture has become the most frequent description of new species in recent years. The ricinuleid have extremely thick cuticle and habits of slow locomotion (Platnick, 2002), which makes your viewing rather limited in active collections, as immobile, to be confused with the substrate they occupy. Species Ricinulei seem conservative, with very similar external morphology (Tourinho &amp; Saturnino, 2010) and some species give the impression of a morphological mosaic of different species.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2015-01-21</date></data>
