In 2005 the method became an European standard (EN 14757). Standardized test-fishing catch most of the Swedish species in a representative way, giving a good estimate of species abundance and size distribution. The results are generally used for purposes of environmental protection and fishery management.NORS consists of thousands of test-fishing occasions back to the 1950&#8217;s. The Department of Aquatic Resources (SLU Aqua) at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences is responsible of collecting and checking test-fishing data generated in national and regional environmental programs, on behalf of the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management. SLU Aqua also collect test-fishing data from several other types of investigations in order to create a database as representative as possible. The purpose is to facilitate obtaining data of high quality for research, national investigations and reports. The database also serves as a reference for local and regional investigations. All data is available for the public.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-06</date></data>
