It is Stenosagola newtoni Park &amp; Carlton, 2013. The material listed herein raises the number of published specimen records for S. newtoni from 2 to 51. All additional 49 specimens are fully winged males, collected in flight intercept traps (FITs), from the South Island of New Zealand. Examination of the new material has resulted in the detection of an error in the original description of S. newtoni, whereby the mirror image of the aedeagus was inadvertently illustrated. It is not a case of genitalic antisymmetry.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2014-10-24</date></data>
