These birds feed on mesopelagic fish and, to a lesser extent, mackerel icefish. Despite their great abundance and comparatively proximate links in the food chain to the toothfish fishery, virtually nothing is known about the foraging ecology of macaroni penguins at HIMI. This will identify which regions of the ocean Macaroni penguins use as foraging areas, and in combination with diet studies quantify the potential for competition with fisheries operations in the HIMI region.The data are stored in a csv excel file.The fields in this dataset are:LatitudeLongitudeDateDirectionRangeSpeedBearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality: 2018-09-24 - The original files was reformatted to fit OBIS/GBFI/IPT Biodiversity.AQ tracking standards, and a new datasheet "MacaroniPenguin.csv" was created. The new dataset contains datasetID, occurrenceID, eventID, eventDate, year, month, day, eventTime, island, locality, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, basisOfRecord, occurrenceStatus, institutionCode, continentCode. The lowest taxonomical rank of the species identified that could be determined is provided, after matched in WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species).&lt;/p&gt;</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-01-24</date></data>
