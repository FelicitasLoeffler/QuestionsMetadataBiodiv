To examine the spatial variation and distribution patterns of metazoan meiobenthos in different seepage-related habitats, samples were collected in two regions off Norway: several pockmarks associated with the Storegga Slide including the Nyegga pockmark area, and the active, methane-venting Haakon Mosby Mud Volcano west of the Barents Sea during the Vicking cruise aboard the RV ''PourquoiPas?'' in May-June 2006. Meiofaunal samples at control sites were sampled with a multiple corer, while the other sites were sampled with push cores operated by the ROV Victor6000.The meiofaunal samples were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde and washed over a 32 mm-mesh sieve. Metazoan meiofauna were extracted by density gradient centrifugation. All material was fixed with 4% buffered formalin and stained with Rose Bengal. The metazoan meiofauna was sorted out, enumerated and identified down to major taxa under the stereomicroscope. Afterwards, abundances of Nematodes were depth integrated over the top 5 cm to gain individual abundances per 10 cm**2.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2012-01-01</date></data>
