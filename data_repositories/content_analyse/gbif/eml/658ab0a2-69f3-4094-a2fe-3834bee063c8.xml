Trapping took place at a number of forest locations in eastern Viti Levu, and one coastal location in Cakaudrove in Vanua Levu.  The main programme took place between 1992 and 1998, with a few records from more recent visits.  This programme resulted in a collection of about 4,700 specimens.  Work is continuing on the collection, with small numbers of additional records being added as new identifications are made.  14 new species have so far been described.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-08-23</date></data>
