We aimed to study if and how the (functional) diversity of lichen communities determines the species diversity and community composition of micro-arthropods (Collembola). We created experimental patches with mixtures of one, two, three, or four different lichen species and placed these in lichen mats in semi-open pine forest (Pinus sylvestris) in Koll&#229;sen, Ski, Norway. The soil micro-arthropods were harvested from the lichen patches after one summer season of incubation.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-05-13</date></data>
