This species is known from only a handful of locations within the Namosi and Navosa Province. A competition was developed through the NatureFiji-MareqetiViti (NFMV) campaign and website to help collect any additional information of emergence from the public with the hopes that we could confirm original distributional information as well as include any possible new credible information of their distribution/emergence. The competition required that certain information was recorded and that a picture was uploaded to help confirm the species and presence.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-06-28</date></data>
