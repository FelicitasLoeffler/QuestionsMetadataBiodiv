The 5,086 mammal skins (over 720 species) date from the 19th century, and includes several rare and endangered species: the African elephant, black rhinoceros, orangutan, mountain gorilla, red wolf, black-footed ferret and snow leopard. The skeleton collection is likewise small (4,776 specimens representing over 770 species), but historically important, and contains a disproportionate number of large animals, among them one of only 7 complete skeletons of the now extinct quagga, and a large series of buffalo skulls from the 1870s.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-11-15</date></data>
