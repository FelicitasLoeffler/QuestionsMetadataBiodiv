We also have moderately large holdings of specimens from the western United States and the West Indies.In addition to fluid specimens, we have a collection of amphibian and reptile tissue samples for genetic analyses. Most of these tissue samples have corresponding voucher specimens in the fluid collection. We also have a histological (slide) collection for studies of reproductive anatomy in amphibians and reptiles.The museum is also home to the Harold A.
