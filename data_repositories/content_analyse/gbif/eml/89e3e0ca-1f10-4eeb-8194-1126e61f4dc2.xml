Within the framework of this PhD project, shallow subtidal and intertidal areas were sampled and for this, a commercial fishing gear for catching adult flatfish, a Dutch beam trawl, was downscaled to a 2 m beam trawl that could be handled and towed with small rubber dinghies by a single or by 2 persons. This 2 m beam trawl showed to be highly efficient in catching juvenile plaice and other epibenthic species. Most of the work on juvenile plaice was carried out at Balgzand, a large (~50 km2) intertidal area in the western Dutch Wadden Sea. Starting with sampling squares, within a few years sampling changed into a system of 9 transects each consisting of 4 hauls. Over the last 35 years, regular biweekly to monthly surveys have been carried in more than 20 years.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-07-21</date></data>
