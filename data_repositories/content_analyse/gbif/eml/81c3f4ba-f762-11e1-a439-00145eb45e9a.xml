The OMZ with its steep gradients of oxygen concentrations allows to determine the oxygen-dependent changes of species compositions in a relatively small area. Our results from sediments of thirteen multicorer stations from 79 to 823 m water depth demonstrate that calcareous species, especially bolivinids dominate the assemblages throughout the OMZ. The depth distribution of several species matches distinct ranges of bottom water oxygen levels. The distribution pattern inferred a proxy which allows to estimate dissolved oxygen concentrations for reconstructing oxygen levels in the geological past.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2011-01-01</date></data>
