The dataset contains over 5,800 fish occurrences sampled in 2008 in riparian habitats along the river Yser. The dataset includes 22 fish species. The data are collected to evaluate the role of restored riparian habitats for the spawning and nursery of juvenile fish and are discussed in Mouton et al. 2011. The dataset also includes the length of the caught fishes.
