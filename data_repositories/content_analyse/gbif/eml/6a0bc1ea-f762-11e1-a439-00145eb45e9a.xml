Palaeoenvironmental indicators for productivity, sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) based on selected organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst species have been established. On the basis of these palaeoenvironmental indicators, a strengthened intensity of the equatorial divergence in the eastern region during glacials and cold periods of interglacials has been reconstructed. The highest SST probably occurred around substage 5.5 and might refer to weakest upwelling intensity. In comparison, SST and SSS appear to have been generally higher in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean, with probably enhanced values during glacial intervals. Pronounced differences in accumulation rates and relative abundances of cysts formed by congruentidiacean dinoflagellates and relative abundances of oligotrophic cyst species between the eastern and the western region can be related to differences in palaeoproductivity, suggesting much higher values in the eastern area. The coherence between variation in frequency of the indicators for productivity and the boreal summer insolation and monsoon intensity in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean suggests an oceanographic reflection of regional intertropical, rather than boreal, dynamics.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2000-01-01</date></data>
