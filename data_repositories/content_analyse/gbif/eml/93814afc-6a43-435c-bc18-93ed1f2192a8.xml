Of the six species of Xanthichthys, it is most similar to the Atlantic X. ringens and the Indo-West Pacific X. lineopunctatus, sharing with these species the character of three pigmented cheek grooves. It is distinctive in its low body scale row count (33-35, other Xanthichthys species with 39 or more), small size (maximum SL 154 mm, other species over 225 mm), and color pattern of scattered dark spots sub-dorsally and no other spots or lines on body.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2014-04-28</date></data>
