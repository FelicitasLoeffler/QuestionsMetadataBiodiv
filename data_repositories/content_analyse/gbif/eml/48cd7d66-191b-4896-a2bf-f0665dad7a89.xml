The Swift Inventory was initially compiled in 2009, and will be updated annually. The dataset is intended to be a comprehensive inventory of common swift (Apus apus) nesting sites, and collates data from a variety of sources, primarily a public request for information and local surveys. An accompanying dataset of low-level screaming swifts (probable breeders) is also available on the NBN.  The Swift Inventory is a cooperative project involving the support of Concern for Swifts - Scotland, London's Swifts, Northern Ireland Swifts, the RSPB, Swift Conservation and UK Swifts.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-05-09</date></data>
