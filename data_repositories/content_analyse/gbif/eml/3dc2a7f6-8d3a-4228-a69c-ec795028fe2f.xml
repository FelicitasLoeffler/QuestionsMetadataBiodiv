Records of INNS are supplied in a separate dataset. Only records where specific permissions have been obtained from the dataset supplier are included. We have also excluded the following records: any which we believe to be already held on the NBN Atlas, any submitted to us by Biological Records Centre or a National Scheme/Society/Conservation organisation, and any owned by Natural Resources Wales (some of which are submitted by Cofnod within three separate datasets). This dataset includes Sensitive species records (as described in our Data Sourcing, Management and Use policy available from the Cofnod website), however they are not sensitive at the resolution supplied and as their site names and any attached comments have been removed.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-07-02</date></data>
