With the funding from Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives Program (TELDAP), all the information is continually updated and can be accessed at http://fishdb.sinica.edu.tw. Currently, The Fish Database of Taiwan contains 3,115 species of fish in Taiwan from 298 families. These numbers do not include unidentified fish species, especially deep-sea fish. In collaboration with the global fish database, FishBase (http://www.fishbase.org), which was developed by the WorldFish Center, The Fish Database of Taiwan has established a Chinese mirror site, through which both databases can access each other&#8217;s fish data. Through this collaboration with FishBase, users of other global databases, such as Species 2000, Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and BioNet-International can also access the latest information about the fish of Taiwan.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2014-03-25</date></data>
