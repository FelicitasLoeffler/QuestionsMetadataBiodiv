They survey located a total of 536-593 singing male at 168 sites across southern Britain and on Jersey. This was the largest number recorded since the species first colonised in the early 1970s. Two-thirds of the population was found in only four counties (Hampshire, Dorset, Devon and Somerset) and one-fifth at three individual sites. Cetti's warblers showed a clear preference for areas for scattered scrub in reed-bed, reed-swamp and by open water. Territory density in these favoured habitats was 0.41 - 2.1 per ha.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
