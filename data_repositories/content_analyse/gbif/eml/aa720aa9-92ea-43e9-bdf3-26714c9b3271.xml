Water depth 0.3-0.8 m at time of sampling. The samples were pooled for taxonomic analysis. The objective was to characterise periphyton biomass and community composition at the site, which was below the Patea Dam and experienced low levels of dissolved oxygen.Note that the exact day of sampling is unknown.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-08-09</date></data>
