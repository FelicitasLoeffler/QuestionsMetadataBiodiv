In this chapter a checklist for the spiders of the prairie provinces (751 species), and surrounding jurisdictions (44 species) is presented along with an overview of all 26 families that occur in the region. Eighteen of the species from the region are adventive. Linyphiidae is by far the dominant family representing 39% of all the species. Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae each represent 8% and three other families account each for 7% (Salticidae, Dyctinidae and Theridiidae). Furthermore, a summary of all biodiversity studies conducted in the Prairies Ecozone and a selection of studies in adjacent transition ecoregions is provided. The Mixed Grassland Ecoregion has the most distinctive assemblage, Schizocosa mccooki and Zelotes lasalanus are common and unique to this ecoregion. Other ecoregions appear to harbour less distinctive assemblages but most ecoregions have been poorly studied. Lack of professional opportunities for spider systematists in Canada remains a major barrier to the advancement of the taxonomy and ecology of this fascinating group of arthropods.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2014-09-15</date></data>
