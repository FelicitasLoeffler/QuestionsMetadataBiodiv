An important feature of the mammal collection at the Museum of Zoology is our emphasis on non-traditional specimens, that is, preparations that go beyond or replace the traditional skin and skull. Our fluid collection numbers over 15,000 specimens.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-27</date></data>
