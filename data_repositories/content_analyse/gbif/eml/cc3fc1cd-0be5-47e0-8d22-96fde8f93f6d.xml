A 100 meter gillnet comprising 3-, 3.5- and 4-inch nylon monofilament mesh sizes was used to capture fish. Gillnet soak times were either 1 or 2 hours, and dependent on prevailing sea and weather conditions. All net deployments began at 1700hrs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dataset is part of the results of research by a Master of Science student at the University of the South Pacific (USP) in Suva, Fiji. The research was funded in part by the SciCOFish programme of the Pacific Community, and the Faculty Research Committee of the Faculty of Science, Technology and Environment (FSTE) at USP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publication of this dataset was funded by the European Union (EU). We are also grateful to GBIF, BID and VertNet for their support in mobilising this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-07-30</date></data>
