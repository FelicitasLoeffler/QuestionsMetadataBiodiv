It represents a long-term series (1993 - 2015) containing 81,908 records that describe the occurrence and incidence of this species. Data were collected by the Regional Ministry of Environment and Territorial Planning of the Andalusian Regional Government within the frame of the &#8220;Plan de Lucha Integrada contra la Procesionaria del Pino&#8221; (Plan for Integrated Control Against the Pine Processionary Moth), which includes a monitoring programme known as COPLAS. In particular, this dataset includes 4,386 monitoring stands which, together with the campaign year, define the dataset events in Darwin Core Archive. Events are related with occurrence data which show if the species is present or absent. In turn, the event data have a measurement associated: degree of infestation. The relevance of this dataset resides in the importance of long-term data, specially for management decisions in relation to forests phytosanitary status and ecological studies about population dynamics of this forest pest, as well as other research areas.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-11-30</date></data>
