To date, over 800 SABAP2 atlasers have collected more than two million records of bird distribution from more than 75% of the quarter degree grid cells in the SABAP2 region. Most of the SABAP1 data were collected in the period 1987&#8211;1991, 20 years ago. The SABAP1 database contains seven million records. One of the SABAP2 objectives is to see how the distributions of the bird species occurring in South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland have changed over the past two decades.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-03-06T14:05:02Z_header</date></data>
