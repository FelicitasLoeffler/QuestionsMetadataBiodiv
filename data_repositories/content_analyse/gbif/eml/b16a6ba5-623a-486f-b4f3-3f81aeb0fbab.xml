It is on the Red List of Birds of Conservation Concern in the UK owing to the rapid decline (&gt;50%) in the UK breeding range over the past 25 years, and has been identified as a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan.  Full surveys of the breeding cirl bunting population in Britain and the Channel Islands was undertaken in 1989, 1998, 2003, and in 2009 to document potential range expansion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The 1989 survey was conducted by the RSPB in conjunction with the Devon Bird Watching and Preservation Society. The 1998 survey was funded by the RSPB and Nature Conservancy Council (NCC) (now Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC)). The 2003 survey was funded by the RSPB, English Nature (now Natural England) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The 2009 survey was funded by the RSPB and Natural England. The surveys were  carried out under the Statutory Conservation Agencies and RSPB Breeding Birds Scheme (SCARABBS) partnership.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
