The separately catalogued collections of amphibians and reptiles total more than 335,000 specimens, of which more than 13,000 have more than one type of preparation. The holdings of the Herpetology collection are computerized, however, inventorying the collection and proofing the database are ongoing processes. The Herpetology collection may be thought of as an ever-growing library of the world's amphibian and reptile faunas. It is an irreplaceable international resource that deserves the best of care.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2016-12-22</date></data>
