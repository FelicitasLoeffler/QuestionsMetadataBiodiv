Our geographic foci lie in the Southeast U.S., with the great biodiversity of crayfish in Alabama, and in Antarctica. We have had several donations from private collections which have increased the geographic scope of the collection, but most of our accessions have been through University research and affiliated persons. The invertebrate collection contains representatives of most non-molluscan phyla, with a concentration in crayfish, echinoderms, and annelids.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-15</date></data>
