ADRON (Anne van Dijk Rijst Onderzoekscentrum Nickerie) is part of SNRI. The Centre is a vehicle for improving the rice sector. SNRI/ADRON saw the opportunity to set-up and maintain a dried collection of weeds. This need was identified years earlier but not given priority. Digitizing the weeds collection and the establishment of the dried collection will ensure data mobilization of weeds since weeds are a major issue in the rice production ecosystem. The collection contains over 500 weeds collected from the rice fields of Suriname, but mainly from the Nickerie district.  Weeds were collected from 2009 until 2013. After a hiatus recollection restarted in 2017.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-08-21</date></data>
