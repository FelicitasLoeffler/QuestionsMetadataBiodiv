Mulligan. Observations and data were recorded once per year in 2017, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2016. Observations were made within a 30 meter by 20 meter macro-plot, within which are smaller 30 meter by 1 meter sub-plots (may be referred to as transects). Data recorded consists of the location of plants within a sub-plot, the number of other P. bellii individuals (rosettes) within the immediate surrounding vicinity of the plant of interest, if the plant was flowering, the number of inflorescences present, the number of fruits present, and if any animal herbivory is exhibited on the plant of interest.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-06-04</date></data>
