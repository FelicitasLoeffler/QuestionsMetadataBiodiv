Various researchers studied the Reserve flora. In 1938, Maria V. Nikolaevskaya published a list of 537 vascular plants species. By 1946, she had noted about 730 species in the protected area. In 1946-1947, special floristic studies were carried out by Sergey V. Golitsyn, he identified 973 species for the Reserve and the area along the railway crossing the protected area (&#1043;&#1086;&#1083;&#1080;&#1094;&#1099;&#1085;, 1961). Since 1988, Elena Starodubtseva has been studying the Reserve flora. The annotated flora list (&#1057;&#1090;&#1072;&#1088;&#1086;&#1076;&#1091;&#1073;&#1094;&#1077;&#1074;&#1072;, 1999) published in 1999 included 969 species directly on the Reserve territory and 69 species in the zone along the railway crossing the Reserve (this territory is not included in the protected area). Over the next 20 years, a large number of new species were identified as a result of annual monitoring of the species composition of vascular plants. According to the data for 2019, the list of flora includes 1,051 species registered directly on the territory of the Reserve.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-09-21</date></data>
