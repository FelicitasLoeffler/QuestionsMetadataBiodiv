Samples were collected during the spring of 2006 at depths ranging from 46 to 208 m, and 56 species belonging to 39 genera and 22 families of Polychaeta (Annelida) were identified. Environmental data of depth (m), salinity (psu), temperature (&#176;C), dissolved oxygen (ml/L) and, sand and mud percentages were also measurement at each station.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-02-14</date></data>
