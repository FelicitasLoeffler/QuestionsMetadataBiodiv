Colombian fishes are nearly 4339 fish species (eighteen fossil and 4321 actual species), representing 1313 genera, 267 Families, 15 Orders and two Classes. Forty three percent inhabits freshwater habitat. Most of the fish species are from Amazonas and Orinoco River Basins (&#193;lvarez et al. 2013).Knowledge of species richness of fish comes mainly from regional research, monitoring associated with environmental permits for construction and energy infrastructure projects, field courses and curriculum reports to the community. Witnesses of this diversity are deposited in Biological Collections, usually administered by higher education institutions or research institutes. In Colombia, Maldonado (2006) reports 20 fish museums the most important not only for its geographical representation but also by their size are the National Institute of Natural Sciences at the National University of Colombia and the Museum of Alexander von Humboldt Institute.Ichthyology collection of the University of Antioquia (CIUA) emerged as a repository of specimens collected in various research projects done by the group of Ichthyology GIUA since 2002. Initially, became part of the collection of Limnology (CLUA) but in 2008 it was registered in the Alexander von Humboldt Institute Museums database. Since then, CIUA cures fish specimens not only from the ichthyologic research at the University of Antioquia but other investigations, monitoring of consulting firms that deliver the material collected in their work and donations from the community. Here, we made a report about information contained in CIUA Fish Museum.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-09-03</date></data>
