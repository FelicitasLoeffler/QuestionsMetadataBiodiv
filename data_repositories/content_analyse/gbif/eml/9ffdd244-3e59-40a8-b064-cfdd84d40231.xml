The collection consists of skeletons (mounted or not), skins (mounted or not), casts, specimens or organs in fluid (alcohol or formalin), and tissues, belonging to different classes and orders.The database ZAC (acronym for &#8220;Zoology, Comparative anatomy&#8221;) exists since 2010. It is the result of the merger of MAMMALIA (former collection of &#8220;Zoologie, Mammif&#232;res et Oiseaux&#8221;) and ANATOMIC (former collection of &#8220;Anatomie compar&#233;e&#8221;). For many groups, computerization is at a preliminary stage, and most entries have not yet been proofed for errors or verified against the collections. Acronym ZM is used for Mammals, ZO for birds and ZA is used for the other classes present in the collection: Reptiles, Amphibians and Fishes.More detailed information can be obtained by writing to the curators and collection managers.The database will help you prepare loan requests or visits to the collection.
