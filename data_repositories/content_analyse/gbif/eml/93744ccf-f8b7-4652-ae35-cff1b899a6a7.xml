They thrive in a broad variety of marine habitats and were found free-living in seawater, associated with micro and macro algae, marine sponges and invertebrates as well as in biofilms, sea ice and sediments. n the present study, we describe the abundance, distribution and diversity of the Roseobacter group in rather oligotrophic deep-sea sediments derived from the Pacific Ocean as all other benthic studies were performed on relatively eutrophic coastal sites or high-energy systems.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-09-06</date></data>
