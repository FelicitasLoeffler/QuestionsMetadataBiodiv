Principal sources of information are the RSPB annual monitoring program and records submitted for inclusion in the Highland Bird Report.  Other data was sourced from NTS, SNH, SWT, RBBP and Forestry Commission amongst others.  Much of the pre-1985 data comes from a historical dataset compiled by Greg Mudge in the early 1990s that sourced many museum collections etc.  In the case of multi-territory lochs, some historical data just refers to the whole loch and does not indicate which territory the record is from. In such cases, a separate entry is made like 'loch name' consolidated.  The inclusion of a site in this dataset does not neccesarily mean that it is a known breeding site.  Some sites are included for future reference as a pair has been noted present in the egg laying period (27 April to 15 June). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The dataset has been split into two different surveys, one contains data from egg collection (Records from egg collection), and the other contains the records from annual surveys (Records from annual surveys).</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
