This DB have 14 Field structures and include professional taxonomic informations on insect species, their images (specimen, gental structure, etc.), and distributional data. including North Korea distribution data In case of insect DB system, geographical data are the most basic information. GIS system is most suitable tools for the managing this data but do not applied in this DB yet. New approach to induce the more effective use of insect Factual-DB such as GIS systems, including recorded all korean insect strongly desired.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-02-28T16:28:33Z_header</date></data>
