A study about the paramo vegetation in the Nari&#241;o volcanoes, Orlando Rangel-Ch and Clara Ariza published in 2000.2. A study by Helmut Sturm and Orlando Rangel in 1985 about the ecology of andean paramos, in the volcanoes of Cumbal and Chiles.3 and 4. The field data from professor Antoine Cleef (1984) with Sonia Salamanca under the ECOANDES project (Tatama transect), collected in the upper part of Tatama massif. Also data collected (in 1983) under the same project by T. van der Hammen, O. Rangel and A. Cleef and published in a study of the paramo vegetation of the Tatama massif in 2005.5. A study about sinecology, diversity and conservation of Andean vegetation in Argelia, Cauca published in 1995 by M.L. Becking.All studies provide information on the occurrence and location of 2983 plant species from the Paramo in this area collected in 139 releves. For the purpose of the GBIF data-publishing, vegetation releve data were converted into species occurrence data.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-06-18</date></data>
