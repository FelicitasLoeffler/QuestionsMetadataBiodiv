The collection consists predominantly of Michigan vertebrates, with smaller invertebrate collections representation, amassed over the last 50 years. The vertebrate component consists of representative mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish, while the majority of the invertebrate collections are insects. These collections support the educational and research efforts of CMU students and faculty members, as well as any interested researchers. The mammal collection includes nearly all currently recognized species from Michigan, as well as complimentary species from throughout the United States. Most specimens are prepared as study skins, but there are several taxidermied mounts and skeletons available for examination.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-07-20</date></data>
