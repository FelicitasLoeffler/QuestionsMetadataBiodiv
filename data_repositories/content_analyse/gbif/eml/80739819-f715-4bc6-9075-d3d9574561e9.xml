Samples were collected using plankton ring nets with the objective to examine seasonal variation in abundance of important species/taxa of zooplankton. This resource focusses on cladocera collected during preliminary sampling in 1967 and during the multidisciplinary program in 1968 and 1969.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-10-23</date></data>
