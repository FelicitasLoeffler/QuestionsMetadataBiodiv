These sources include:- The organisation that collected the data (e.g. a provincial authority, the Limburg Natural History Society)- The method used (e.g. a vegetation study, a full area inventory survey, or a monitoring program)- Medium (e.g. digital or paper form or report)- Characterists of the project (e.g. work placement or atlas project) for which the observations were made.Many of these projects employ a standardised method of collecting data, which will be added to the observations in the future. For now, these observations will be categorised as individual observations.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/12-006-florabase-overige-losse-waarnemingen-na-1993/</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-03-26</date></data>
