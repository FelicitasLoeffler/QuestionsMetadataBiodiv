However, our knowledge of the extent and character of                bacterial diversity in polar marine environments is still limited. Here we present                the use of high throughput DNA pyrosequencing and statistical inference to assess                the diversity of planktonic bacteria in the arctic Canada Basin, and Kongsfjorden in                Spitsbergen. The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from seawater samples                collected from the upper water column. The number of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences                obtained from each sites varied from 7433 to 9218. In the Canada Basin, the most                abundant bacterial groups in two sites of water at 10m depth were the Proteobacteria                (mainly Alphaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria.                Different bacterial communities were observed in the deeper water (80 or 100m depth)                at the two sites. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes also formed the dominant                bacterial groups in surface water of Kongsfjorden. However, Gammaproteobacteria                accounted for more than 90% of the Proteobacteria.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-05</date></data>
