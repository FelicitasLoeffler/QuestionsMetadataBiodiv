It is a mountainous region comprising two districts, North Waziristan and South Waziristan that are now included in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. There are no checklists for the region, let alone a flora. It is also poorly represented in the world's herbaria, including those of Pakistan. BANNU was established in 1960 but has only recently (2017) been given the support required to make significant progress in documenting and summarizing Waziristan's florist diversity and its use by local people.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-14</date></data>
