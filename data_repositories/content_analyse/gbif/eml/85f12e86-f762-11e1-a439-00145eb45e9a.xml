Half of the plantations were organic the other half were with conventional use of pesticides. In total about 850 samples were collected and 151.834 specimens of arthropods (and snails) were identified. Analyses were made of relationships between the cultural method, flora and fauna.  Results indicate a potential for exploiting natural regulating factors of pests depending of choice of tree species composition in the hedgerows</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2016-12-20</date></data>
