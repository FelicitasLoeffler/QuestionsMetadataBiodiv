This dataset includes the following species: Azolla filiculoides, Crassula helmsii, Elodea canadensis, Elodea nuttalli, Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera, Lagarosiphon major, Myriophyllum aquaticum and Nymphoides peltata.  These records are from the data holdings of Dorset Environmental Records Centre which covers both terrestrial and marine taxa, the majority dating from 1976 onwards but also including historical records.  The database includes records from site and species surveys by staff and local naturalists, extractions of records from literature, records from other organisations which hold records for Dorset, and records sent in by the general public.  The data quality is therefore variable but all records have been through a basic validation process by local experts before entry.  This dataset has been submitted to the NBN Gateway as part of the South West Pilot Project Case Studies work.
