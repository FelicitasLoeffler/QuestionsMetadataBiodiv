Their ratios in samples were used to determine temperature of the water surface layer during the last glaciation. Benthic foraminifera were studied in 12 samples of surface sediments and in five cores, and conclusions made on changes in the bottom water layer from changes in composition of these benthic foraminifera.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1985-01-01</date></data>
