However, the microbial communities in the coal gangue that may generate the AMD and function as the seed bank of microbiota for AMD-related environments are still under-explored. In this study, we characterized the microbial communities within these under-explored extreme habitats and compared with those in the downstream AMD creek. In addition, the interplay between the microbiota and the environmental parameters was statistically investigated.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
