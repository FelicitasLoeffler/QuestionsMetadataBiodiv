The consortium will identify priority invasive alien species and threatened species for data mobilization, and publish relevant data from collections in France, Netherlands and Belgium. More than 200,000 records of biodiversity data will be made available through GBIF.org and national portals.Based on published data, the consortium will develop distribution maps of priority species, suggest actions to monitor and control the spread of invasive alien species and provide recommendations for the conservation of threatened species.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-08-17</date></data>
