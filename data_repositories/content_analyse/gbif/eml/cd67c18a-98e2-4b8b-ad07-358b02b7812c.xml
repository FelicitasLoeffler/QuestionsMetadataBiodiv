Ecologically, these regions fall within the transitional, dry semi deciduous, dry deciduous, moist ever green and wet ever green forests zones of Ghana, with parts of the area falling within the wildfire prone areas. These areas are characterized by high diversity of pioneer tree species. The sampling of flora species were restricted to thirteen (13) selected forest reserves that were found between latitudes 7.906669 North  and 5.317087 South and longitudes-3.006151 West and -1.854438 East. Out of the sampled forest reserves, six (6), four (4) and three (3) were moist semi-deciduous, moist evergreen and dry semi-deciduous forest types respectively. The information taken from these reserves were baseline biological and carbon survey data.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-10-02</date></data>
