The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;Ecosystem services like pollination are affected by a variety of factors in agricultural used landscapes. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of land use intensity, local management and landscape structure on pollination services of bees.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2016-09-23</date></data>
