Bioindicators or ecological indicators are taxa or groups of animals or plants that show signs when affected by environmental pressures due to human activities or the destruction of the biotic system.  This result is from funding by GBIF (BID-AF2017-0311) and University of Lagos, Nigeria(CRC 2016/21) that involved the Digitization and Mobilization of Odonata of Southern Nigeria and molecular characterization, DNA barcoding and banking of Odonata of South western Nigeria respectively. So far, over 4000 colletions from Lagos, Osun, Oyo and Ondo States have been digitized. Odonate collections from Akwa Ibom State comprised 836 individuals from 23 species, and four families. The families were Libellulidae (75%), Coenagrionidae (24%), Calopterygidae (0.1%) and Chlorocyphidae (0.4%). Three dominant species found from the collections include Palpopleura lucia (39%), Orthetrum chrysostigma (9%) and Pseudagrion kersteni (9%). Two species with only one individual were Phaon iridipennis and Thoymis tillarga.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-08-26</date></data>
