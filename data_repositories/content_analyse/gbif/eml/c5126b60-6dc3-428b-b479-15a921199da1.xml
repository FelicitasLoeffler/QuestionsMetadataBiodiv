The dataset was developed to identify and map freshwater species occurrences throughout Florida. These data are the results of data collection/processing by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for many federally funded fisheries projects. These data were compiled into a comprehensive and standardized fisheries database for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission from various data programs and paper files. Collection location coordinates were based upon limited global positioning system (GPS) information, written information, the use of digital orthophoto quadrangles, digital raster graphic maps, and ArcView programs to obtain an estimated latitude and longitude for each fish collection site.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-06-12</date></data>
