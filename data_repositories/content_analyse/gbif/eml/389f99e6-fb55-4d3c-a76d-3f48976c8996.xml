N.B. this dataset is an interim upload to allow Article 17 reporting to be completed. The data are being entered into Marine Recorder and a regular export will be carried out once this is complete. This export will replace this dataset.  This dataset is a collation of records that constitutes a gap filling exercise rather than a coherent dataset in itself. Consequently it should not be viewed as being spatially or temporally representative. However, it may be used in combination with other data to make assessments of the range and / or occurrence of relevant species.  We have high confidence in the taxonomic quality of the records.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-11-17</date></data>
