The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;Bryophytes confirm a species rich plant group in ecosystems such as forests. We assessed bryophyte species diversity in relationship to forest-management types on 1050 forest plots.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2016-09-23</date></data>
