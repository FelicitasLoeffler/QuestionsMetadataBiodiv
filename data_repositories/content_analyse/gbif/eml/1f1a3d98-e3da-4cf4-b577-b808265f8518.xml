On their surface, distinct cylindrical holes filled with meltwater and sediments are considered as hot spots for microbial life. The present project addresses possible biological interactions5 within the community of prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae (microal- gae) and relations to their potential grazers, additional to their environmental controls.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
