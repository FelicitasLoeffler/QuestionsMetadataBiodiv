The dataset contains over 5,800 beetle occurrences sampled between 1998 and 1999 from 28 locations on the left bank (Belgium) of the river Meuse on the border between Belgium and the Netherlands. The dataset includes over 100 ground beetles species (Carabidae) and some non-target species. The data were used to assess the dynamics of the Grensmaas area and to help river management.
