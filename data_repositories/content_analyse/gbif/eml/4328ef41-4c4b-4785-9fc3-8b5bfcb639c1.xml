We attempt to reveal the chemical composition (before and after culturing) of our samples and to compare the bacterial populations founded with those from worldwide sites where microbialites thrive, in order to discern bacterial communities drivers within similar ecosystems.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
