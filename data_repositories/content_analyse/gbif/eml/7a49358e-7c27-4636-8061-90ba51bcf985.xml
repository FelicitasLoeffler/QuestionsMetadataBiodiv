Microbial genomic DNA was extracted from the polycarbonate membranes (microbial cells filtered) and the 16S rRNA gene sequences (v3+v4) were amplified by PCR.We classified the OTUs based on their phylogenetic affiliations and determined their relative proportions on the total number of sequencing reads.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
