BFB sites are monitored (usually annually) to ensure the populations are being kept at healthy levels and management techniques instigated at sites to conserve populations are working. Volunteers known as Flora Guardians undertake the majority of monitoring - this group of 400 volunteers allows Plantlife to have a presence at 240 sites across the UK.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
