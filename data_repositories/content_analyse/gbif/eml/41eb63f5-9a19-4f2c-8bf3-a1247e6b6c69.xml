After the project was initiated the scope of the study was broadened to investigate the age, growth (by otoliths) and reproductive dynamics (by GSI and histology) of these species. Tissue samples from at about 100 specimens representing each species were also taken and stored in DMSO solution and is available for any researcher wishing to undertake a genetic stock structure study. This study was solely funded by CMR as a pilot study. As a result of limited funds, fish specimens were collected opportunistically from recreational fisher donations, commercial catches and from bycatch samples from scientific cruises. As a result, the capture location of the majority of specimens does not have a lat/long, and is generally only identified by the general area of capture (i.e. 'Weipa' or 'Gladstone'). The method of capture was recorded to the best of our knowledge (i.e. hook and line, gillnet etc), although actual gear specifications and shot information were generally not available.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-07-03</date></data>
