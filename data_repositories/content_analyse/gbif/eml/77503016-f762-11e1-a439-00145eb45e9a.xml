"Meteor", representatives of 7 families of benthic abyssal gastropods were collected. The prevalent group was the Turridae, the Naticidae are represented by 2 species, the remaining families by a single species each. A survey of the frequency and distribution of the species within the study area is given. A systematic part deals with the individual species in detail, including notes on taxonomy, material and distribution. Concerning the composition of the abyssal gastropod fauna of the present material, Neogastropoda are 4 times as many as Archaeogastropoda and 6 times as many as Mesogastropoda and Opisthobranchia. 89 % of all specimens are Neogastropoda. Usually deep-sea organisms have a non-pelagic development, but many of the Iberian deep-sea Turrids have a planktotrophic protoconch, that means a long pelagic larval period. Among the 19 species, 2 are cosmopolitan, 9 show a transatlantic distribution and 8 are confined to East-Atlantic basins.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1979-01-01</date></data>
