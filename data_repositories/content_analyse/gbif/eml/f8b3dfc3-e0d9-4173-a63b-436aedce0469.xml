Now there are two herbarium collections with their own acronyms and registrations in the Index Herbariorum: M.G. Popov Herbarium (NSK) and I.M. Krasnoborov Herbarium (NS). Approximately 800,000 herbarium specimens of higher vascular plants, mosses, lichens and fungi collected in Siberia, Russian Far East, Europe, Asia and North America are stored in NSK and NS.Digitization of the higher vascular plants at 600 dpi was initiated in 2014 using a special scanner, Herbscan, starting with type specimens. In 2017 a new research group &#8220;USU-Herbarium&#8221; was organized in CSBG for the digitization and management of herbarium collections. Herbarium specimens are being digitized using three customized scanners: Herbscan and two ObjectScan 1600, according international standarts at 600 dpi, with barcode, 24-color scale and scale bar. Images and metadata are stored in the CSBG Database (http://84.237.85.99:8081) generated by ScanWizard Botany and MiVapp Botany software (Microtek, Taiwan).</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-08-09</date></data>
