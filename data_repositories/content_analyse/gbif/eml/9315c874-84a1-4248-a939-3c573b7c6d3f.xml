Recently, we reported a new record of H. major in Thai waters, and identify key characters to distinguish those overlapping morphological characteristic between H. ovalis and H. major (Tuntiprapas et al., 2015). We have extensive collections of H. ovalis, with a total of 266 samples covered not only in Thai waters but also Johor, Malaysia and Hong Kong, we are also interested in population genetic and ecological adaptations of this very common and high plasticity of this species.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-02-28</date></data>
