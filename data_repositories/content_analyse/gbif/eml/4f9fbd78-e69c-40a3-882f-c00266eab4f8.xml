By pyrosequencing ribosomal RNA genes and characterizing multiple environmental factors, we investigated temporal and spatial patterns of a- and &#223;-diversities of microeukaryotes in near-surface sediments of three basins of the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-09-04</date></data>
