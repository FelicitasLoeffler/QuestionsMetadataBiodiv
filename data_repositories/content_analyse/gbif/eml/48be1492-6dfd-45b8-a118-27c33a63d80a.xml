These assemblages were compared with other North Atlantic DSDP sites and with onshore sections in Denmark, southern England, Spain, and Italy. Some environmental interpretation is attempted for the Miocene assemblages, pollen, spores, and dinoflagellate cyst species were used to interpret the proximity of the shoreline. Key species are illustrated, along with some forms that are not discussed.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1985-01-01</date></data>
