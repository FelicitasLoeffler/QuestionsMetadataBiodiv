Given the increasing importance of molecular studies (which rely heavily on frozen tissues), the value of this collection is certain to increase in the future.The collection regularly provides samples of tissues to U.S. and foreign scientists. These tissues are used for a wide variety of studies in forensics, epidemiology, conservation, wildlife management, comparative molecular genetics, and phylogenetics. Many tissue samples in the collection are from Neotropical species whose habitats have been disturbed or destroyed. Thus, we have a DNA (genetic) record of those organisms, even though the species themselves may be extinct in all or part of their former range.For information about how to obtain a tissue loan see: https://sites01.lsu.edu/wp/mns/files/2015/09/tissuegrantpolicy-2015.pdf</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2016-12-22</date></data>
