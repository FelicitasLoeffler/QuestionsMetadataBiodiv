We will test the following hypotheses:1. The subsurface microbial communities in the Hiolo area and Spillway area have different compositions that are related to local fluid chemistry, and2. The dominant species in microbial mats at Loihi Seamount are seeded by subsurface populations present in diffuse flow fluids. It is likely that the dominant mat species are present but not dominant in the subsurface, and bloom in the transition zone at the seafloor where warm, reduced anoxic fluids mingle with cool,oxic seawater.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-05</date></data>
