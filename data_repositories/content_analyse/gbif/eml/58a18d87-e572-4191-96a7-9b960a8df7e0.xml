Through conservation effort from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the decline was reversed. This dataset contains corncrake records from all annual surveys of corncrake since 1993, monitoring the increase in corncrake numbers since then. These surveys have been funded mainly by SNH and RSPB, but also by other partners in SCARABBS (Statutory Conservation Agencies and RSPB Breeding Birds Scheme). For each year, a record in the dataset specifies the centre of the territory of one male corncrake. Territory centres are calculated from locations of singing males, recorded on multiple visits to each area covered (calls heard on separate occasions less than 200m apart are assumed to be the same bird). Since territory centres are calculated mean locations of male corncrakes, they are provided at 100m resolution, irrespective of the precision of the observations they are based upon. All observations of singing males are provided in the dataset Annual corncrake surveys in Britain (raw data, multiple observations of each singing male). This dataset also contains the 1988 national survey, for which territory centres were not calculated.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-06-16</date></data>
