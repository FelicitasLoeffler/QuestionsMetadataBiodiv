Historically contaminated subsurface sediment was used to monitor hydrocarbon degradation behavoir under sulphate reducing and methanogenic conditions over 450 days. Total RNA was isolated from experimental sets and reverse-transcribed to cDNAs. Phylogenetic marker gene 16S rDNA was amplified with eubacterial and archaeal universal primers and amplicons were sequenced on Roche 454 sequencing platform.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-04-06</date></data>
