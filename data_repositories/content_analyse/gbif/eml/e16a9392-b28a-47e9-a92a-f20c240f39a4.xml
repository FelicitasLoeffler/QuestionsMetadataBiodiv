They are based on field studies, performed on basis of the &#8220;Lake Moldino&#8221; biological station of Moscow High School # 1543 in 2007&#8211;2016 by numerous teachers and students (principal investigators Liudmila A. Abramova and Polina A. Volkova). Georeferences are based on 105 squares 5 km &#215; 5 km (occurrences are placed in the grid square centroids). Several squares were investigated twice, results of both surveys are given separately, so some records are duplicated (if a species was recorded during both surveys of one square). The analysis of the dataset has been published by Volkova et al. (2016, 2018).</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-12-12</date></data>
