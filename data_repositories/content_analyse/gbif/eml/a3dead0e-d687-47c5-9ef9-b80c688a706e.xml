The Everglades amphibian community is ideal because amphibians are present in all habitats and under all hydrologic regimes.  During Everglades restoration, hydrologic patterns will change and the response of ecological indicators will determine success. Fourteen amphibian species were detected through VES, vocalization surveys and trapping methods throughout the study and the occurrence information collected in this project database.
