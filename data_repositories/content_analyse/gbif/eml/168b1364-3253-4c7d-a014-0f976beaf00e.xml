These includeing, but are not limited to: H2S formation, souring and corrosion caused mainly by sulfate-reducing microorganisms. To prevent biogenic sulfate reduction, nitrate can be used as an environmentally friendly alternative to biocides. However, side effects of nitrate injection are sometimes observed but not well understood. In our study, we used original water from an onshore reservoir, where a microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) application is planned, and investigated the effects of nitrate addition on H2S generation, mineral precipitation and microbiology. We observed that nitrate did inhibit H2S formation in most, but not all cases while available in the medium. During nitrate reduction, iron and calcite minerals precipitated over short- and long-term (10 or 160 days) incubations. This was caused by a nitrate-reducing group of bacteria belonging to the family Deferribacteraceae. Using dynamic sandpack setups and numerical modeling approaches with the simulator TOUGHREACT, we observed significant reduction in permeabilities (~44x) suggesting injectivity issues over time in case nitrate is continuously added to the reservoir. Our study shows that nitrate-dependent processes, which were described separately for pure-cultures before, are also valid for natural mixed communities present in oil fields and underlines the complex interplay of microbial metabolisms associated with those communities.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-08-02</date></data>
