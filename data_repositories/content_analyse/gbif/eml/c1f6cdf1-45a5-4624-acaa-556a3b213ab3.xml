Early Pliocene assemblages, which were poorly known until now, are present and can be correlated locally between DSDP Holes 504, 503A, and 495, using species events associated with the new Dictyocha pulchella Subzone and Dictyocha angulata Subzone. Silicoflagellate relative paleotemperature values show major warming at 4.7 to 5.0 Ma (Cores 45-48), 3.4 to 3.8 Ma (Cores 32-33), 1.5 to 1.7 Ma (Cores 12-16), and 0.5 to 0.8 Ma (Cores 3-6). Major coolings occurred at 5.0 to 5.1 Ma (Core 51), 3.9 to 4.4 Ma (Cores 38-44), and 1.0 to 1.3 Ma (Cores 8-10). The appearance of Dictyocha longa is proposed to replace the asperoid/fibuloid ratio reversal as the bottom of the Dictyocha fibula Zone, because the non-evolutionary ratio reverses several times in the upper Miocene of Hole 503A, and at least once in Hole 504. Three new Pliocene silicoflagellates are defined: Dictyocha concinna Bukry, n. sp., D. helix Bukry, n. sp., and D. tamarae Bukry, n. sp.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>1983-01-01</date></data>
