The samples were collected during an environmental monitoring cruise in Hardangerfjorden. Foraminiferal assemblage ananlyses were undertaken by the Department of Geociences, University of Oslo. The study provided new insights into the foraminiferal diversity in the Hardangerfjord. Samples were taken from gravity core tops or grab samples. The data represent the occurrence of living benthic foraminifera in the upper sediment centimeter (0-1cm).</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-07-09</date></data>
