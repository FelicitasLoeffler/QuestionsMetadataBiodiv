The ornithology collection at National Museums of Kenya, holds over 30,000 specimens each carrying important information such as their occurrence across space and time. We mined data (species name, locality, collection date etc.) from these specimens collected from the Tana River Basin. Here, we present a geo-referenced dataset of avian species collected from 1911 to 2004.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-07-31</date></data>
