To date, many studies have quantified rates of sulfate reduction in hydrothermal-influenced sediments and vent isolated microorganisms, but only one study of sulfate reduction exists for hydrothermal deposits.  Here we present rates of microbially-mediated sulfate reduction &#8211;as determined via 35S tracer studies- from three distinct hydrothermal deposits recovered from the Middle Valley vent field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge.  We further evaluate these rates in the context of the in situ geochemistry and microbial community structure of each chimney to better constrain linkages between phylogeny and function.
