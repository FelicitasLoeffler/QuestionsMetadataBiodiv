Within the scope of the REVIZEE Program, we assessed some aspects of the deep macrofauna, those that related the abundance of populations to general oceanographic features, in order to add to the understanding of the dynamics of the overall availability of live resources.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-11-12T15:53:23Z_header</date></data>
