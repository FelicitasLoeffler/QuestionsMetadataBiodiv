This cruises were carried out accoding to the same protocols with similar equipment and at the same locations as the EMOWAD programme in 1986: bimonthly demersal fish survey were carried out in the intertidal, subtidal and tidal gullies in the Marsdiep and Vlie basin of the western Dutch Wadden Sea in 2009 and in the Marsdiep basin only in 2010. Sampling took place with rubber dinghies in the intertidal and in deeper waters with RV Navicula. All the fish were identified and measured on board. The programme lasted for two year covering 2009 and 2010.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-07-21</date></data>
