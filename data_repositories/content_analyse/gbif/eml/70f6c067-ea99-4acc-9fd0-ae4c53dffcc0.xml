Volunteer bird watchers select their own area and every winter they count twice, in December and in late January / early February. Also the absence of Great Grey Shrikes was noted (0 counts). The results of these yearly counts are captured in maps that show the presence / absence of these birds (http://waarneming.nl/tel_project_new/gmap/238). For this dataset, covering the winter of 2010 / 2011, in total 219 individual birds were monitored in 198 areas. The dataset contains multiple counts per individual.Result document can be found on http://www.scribd.com/doc/49783860/Eindresultaten-landelijke-klapekstertelling-2010-2011</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2015-11-23</date></data>
