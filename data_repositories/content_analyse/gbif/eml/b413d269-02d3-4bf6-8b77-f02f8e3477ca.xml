In contrast to CLIMAP Project Members [1981], the reconstructed SSTs indicate cooler glacial SSTs in the entire tropical/subtropical South Atlantic with strongest cooling in the upwelling region off Namibia (7&#8211;10&#176;C) and smallest cooling (1&#8211;2&#176;C) in the western subtropical gyre. In the western Atlantic, our data support recent temperature estimates from other proxies. In the upwelling regions in the eastern Atlantic, our data conflict with SST reconstructions from alkenones, which may be due to an environmental preference of the alkenone-producing algae or to an underestimation of foraminiferal SSTs due to anomalous high abundances of N. pachyderma (sinistral).</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2000-01-01</date></data>
