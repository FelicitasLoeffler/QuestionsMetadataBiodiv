In order to study the variability in impact of epibenthic predators on especially newly-settled bivalves, in 1983 a series of observations of densities of juvenile epibenthic predators (shrimps and shore crabs) was started on 3 locations, in 1998 extended to 5 locations at Balgzand and still running. As a result of the first inventory a bi-annual sampling programme (late winter/late summer) at three transects was started in 1989 in the Marsdiep tidal basin in the framework of the RWS BIOMON monitoring and carried out by NIOZ until recently.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2017-07-21</date></data>
