There are however, both wet and dry preserved specimens of a wide array of taxa from the entire world. The collections also include eggs and skeletons.The collection contains in total slightly less than 63 000 specimens, of which about half are birds. Fishes, amphibians &amp; reptiles, and mammals are represented by roughly 10 000 specimens each.
