Previous results of stable isotope and magnetic susceptibility measurements as well as of planktonic foraminiferal temperature reconstruction from this core, suggest the occurrence of &#8220;Heinrich-like events&#8221; (i.e. large ice-sheet decay) during Marine Isotopic Stage 5 (MIS 5). Dinoflagellate assemblages of this time period have revealed six dinocyst events that are characterised by peaks in Bitectatodinium tepikiense percentages. These events occur synchronously with &#8220;Heinrich-like events&#8221; previously identified. They are coeval with major retreats of the forest on land, indicating, therefore, drastic changes in the regional climate. However, results from the Ice-Rafted Detritus (IRD) analysis of the &gt;150 ?m lithic fraction shows that MIS 5 of MD952042 has only recorded one significant input of iceberg discharge, located at the MIS 6/MIS 5 transition. It seems therefore that it is the only event that could be called a &#8220;true Heinrich event&#8221;.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2000-01-01</date></data>
