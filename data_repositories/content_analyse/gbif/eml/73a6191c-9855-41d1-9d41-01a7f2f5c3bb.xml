The monitoring programs work with plots of 10 trees (with some exceptions). All species are noted on a form, along with their abundance. Each plot visit takes about half an hour. Visits are repeated every 3 to 10 years. The monitoring program is only carried out by professional, trained observers.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.114,806 records (March 2018)NDFF protocol 1.203  https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/2-203-provinciale-epifytenmeetnet-mossen-en-korstmossen/</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2018-03-27</date></data>
