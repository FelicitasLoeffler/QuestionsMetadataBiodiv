The collection consists predominantly of Michigan vertebrates, with smaller invertebrate collections representation, amassed over the last 50 years. The vertebrate component consists of representative mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish, while the majority of the invertebrate collections are insects. These collections support the educational and research efforts of CMU students and faculty members, as well as any interested researchers. The reptile collection includes all currently recognized species from Michigan, as well as complimentary species from throughout the United States, with exemplars from Central America and the Caribbean Islands and a few additional international locations. Most specimens are stored in ethanol, but there are several dried specimens (e.g., turtle shells) and skeletal preps available for examination.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-03-08</date></data>
