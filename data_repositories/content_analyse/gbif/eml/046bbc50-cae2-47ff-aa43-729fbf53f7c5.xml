Its goal is to eliminate the need for repeated reference to primary sources for basic bibliographic information about plant names. 				The data are freely available and are gradually being standardized and checked. 				IPNI is a dynamic resource, depending on direct contributions by all members of the botanical community.				IPNI is the product of a collaboration between The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, The Harvard University Herbaria, and the Australian National Herbarium.</eml:eml/dataset/abstract/para><date>2019-10-31</date></data>
