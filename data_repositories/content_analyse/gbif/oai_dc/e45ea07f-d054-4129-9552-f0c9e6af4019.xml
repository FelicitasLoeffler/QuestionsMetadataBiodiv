The dataset includes all the archival records which have so far been digitised, plus modern data which is included on receipt. A portion of the Society's marine records still remain in paper format. Many of the records have never been held centrally, by the Marine Recorder, the custodians have been the respective sea area representatives. A programme is underway to trace some of these archives in order to facilitate their digitisation, along with records already held centrally but waiting to be processed. This dataset is constituted from data where the recorder has signed the Society's access policy and represents the majority of the data holdings. The remainder of the records are held in a separate dataset on the NBN Atlas where access is more restricted.|The dataset is a combination of data collected for numerous purposes, originally to study and determine the distribution of mollusc species in British and Irish waters and subsequently to monitor any changes in these patterns.|145,632 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
