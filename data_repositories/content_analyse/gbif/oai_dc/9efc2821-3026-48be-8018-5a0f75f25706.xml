A total of 24 species of freshwater snails (gastropods) accompanied with information on the species distribution (Locality and georeferenced information) is presented.  The occurrence data indicate that majority of the gastropods voucher material housed at NMK collections were collected from Kenya.  A number of material however are from other countries particularly Tanzania and Uganda.  The occurrence data also indicate that Melanoides tuberculata is the most widespread freshwater snail species in Kenya and Eastern Africa.  Several species appears restricted to one wetland.  For instance, Biomphalaria choanomphala, Bellamya costulata and Bellamya constricta appeared restricted to Lake Victoria.  The presented information contributes in enhancing knowledge of freshwater gastropods biodiversity. The presented information is also important for application in planning conservation of biodiversity by using the data for focusing conservation efforts in the species geographical ranges.  The information presented also forms basis for planning research on gastropods to further promote knowledge on gastropods biodiversity.  The project was funded by the European Union through GBIF to mobilize freshwater snails information housed at Zoological collection of the National Museums of Kenya and literature.|203 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
