Surveys conducted annually (few exceptions) from 1996 to 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling is performed using a "stone-buoy longline" similar to the one used in the commercial demersal fishery in the Azores. The sampling is stratified and random based on depth and geographic areas from 25 meters to 1200 meters mostly, but few sets down to 2000 meters. In some sets a different longline design was used (see Menezes et al. 2009). Soak time was usually 2 to 3 hours, but deeper sets (below 1000 meters) have longer soaks times. Chopped and salted sardines were used as bait.&lt;/p&gt;|9,837 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
