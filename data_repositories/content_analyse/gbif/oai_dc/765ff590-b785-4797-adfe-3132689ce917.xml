The wetlands sampled represented the "best available" in the regions sampled (i.e. all were relatively unimpacted). In general samples were from the west of the country as no eastern areas were considered to have unimpacted wetlands. At each site, where possible, an algae sample was collected from the benthos (sediment) and from submerged plants (epiphytic). The data on diatoms were obtained from counts of species on permanent slides prepared from the samples by acid-cleaning. The data are reported as relative abundnaces (%). The project was aimed at decribed the biodiversity of algae in wetlands and relating this to wetland characteristics.|4,610 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
