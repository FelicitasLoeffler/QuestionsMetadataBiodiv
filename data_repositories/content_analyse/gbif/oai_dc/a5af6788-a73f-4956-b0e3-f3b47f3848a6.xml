It was prepared by Ji&#345;&#237; Kva&#269;ek with help of Olexandra Chernomorets. The dataset comprises all described unequivocal fossil members of the Ginkgoales (fossil plant remains which could be assigned to this group with certainty). It is based on reproductive structures assigned to Ginkgoales and their associated organs. As a part of this dataset there are main taxa of foliage and wood structures assigned to the group with high degree of probability. Additional taxa of Ginkgoales are a part of another version, which is in state of preparation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
