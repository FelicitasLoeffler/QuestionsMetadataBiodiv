The survey was organized by OBSnatur (Friluftsr&#229;det (The Outdoor Council) and ConDidact (Danish private company with several websites used for teaching pupils about e.g. Danish animals, www.danske-dyr.dk)) in collaboration with Natural History Museum, Aarhus. The participants searched for 5 species of snails: &#8226;	Arion ater (European Black Slug, Danish: Sort skovsnegl)&#8226;	Arion rufus (Large Red Slug, Danish: R&#248;d skovsnegl)&#8226;	Arion cf. vulgaris (Spanish slug, Danish: Iberisk skovsnegl) &#8226;	Helix pomatia (Burgundy Snail, Danish: Vinbjergsnegl)&#8226;	Cornu aspersum (Garden Snail, Danish: Plettet voldsnegl)The project invited the public to search for specific species in their local area. Species descriptions, instructions etc. were made available on a project website (http://danske-dyr.dk/Sv%C3%A6r/naturjagter/Den%20store%20Sneglejagt%202006/). Observations of species could be submitted through an online form. The species observations were documented by digital photos, and later were validated by scientific experts.|2,174 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
