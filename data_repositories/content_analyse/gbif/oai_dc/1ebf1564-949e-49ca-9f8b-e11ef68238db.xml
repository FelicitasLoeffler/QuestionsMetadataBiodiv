We also maintain the Mudge Library, a large collection of rare and important ornithological and zoological books, as well as the Museum's own collection records and historical archives. The collections of the Perot Museum were begun by the Dallas Museum of Natural History in the 1930s. With approximately 100,000 specimens currently catalogued, we continue to grow and expand the collection in support of ongoing research projects and discoveries. Collections are housed at both the Victory Park and Fair Park locations, where they are cared for by Karen Morton, our collections manager.|7,509 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
