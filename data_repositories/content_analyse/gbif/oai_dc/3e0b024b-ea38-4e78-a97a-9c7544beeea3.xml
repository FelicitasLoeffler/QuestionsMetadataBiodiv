Data consists mainly of botanical records from old recording cards, although there are some records for other taxa.  Paper copies of these surveys are held by Essex Biodiversity Project, scanned copies of the site descriptions and sketch maps accompanying this data are held digitally by Essex Wildlife Trust Biological Records Centre.|The original data was collected to provide summary information on Essex rivers for use by the National Rivers Authority.  This dataset was subsequently digitised for use by the Environment Agency and to complement more recent river walkover surveys completed by Essex Wildlife Trust and Essex Biodiversity Project in partnership with the Environment Agency. for more details of recent surveys please see www.essexrivershub.org.uk|8,497 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
