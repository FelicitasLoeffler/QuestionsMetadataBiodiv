It is envisaged that the compiled data will be a valuable aid to a variety of interests towards generating awareness and appreciation of trees and particularly in developing more informed policies about the future management and conservation of Ireland's Heritage Trees.  Such interests include local authorities, planners, landscape architects, property developers, environmentalists, communities, conservation groups.  It may also include students, dendrologists, botanists, scientists, arborists, foresters, the media &#8211; writers &amp; television, and anyone with an interest in trees.  Furthermore, Heritage Trees suitably marked on site can be an added attraction for visitors to tourism areas.|724 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
