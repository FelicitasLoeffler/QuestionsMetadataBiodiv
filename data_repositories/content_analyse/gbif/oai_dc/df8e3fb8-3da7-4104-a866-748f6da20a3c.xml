The database will be comprehensive, standardized, quality controlled, and networked to outside resources. The database schema accommodates both linear (trawls, transects) and point (samples, observations) data. The structure of the database is tailored to occurrence records of all the azooxanthellate corals, a subset of all corals, and all sponge species. Records shallower than 50 m are generally excluded in order to focus on predominantly deep-water species &#8211; the mandate of the DSC-RTP. The intention is to limit the overlap with light-dependent (and mostly shallow-water) corals.|333,324 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
