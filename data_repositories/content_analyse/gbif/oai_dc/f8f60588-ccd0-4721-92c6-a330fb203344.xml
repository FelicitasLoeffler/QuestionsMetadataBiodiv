Data were collected between November 2008 and April 2010 during field visits to 27 known or presumed bat roosts used for hibernation and/or reproduction, within a 15-km radius buffer around the Tua valley. The presence of individuals was recorded by direct observation. When the identification raised doubts, or the numbers were too high to allow individual examination, the specimens were photographed for later identification. The records include taxa identified at the species or genus level. In several occasions it was not possible to separate the potential species of the genus Myotis, so they were simply included in 2 &#8220;species complexes&#8221;: &#8220;large&#8221; Myotis (2 species) and &#8220;small&#8221; Myotis (5 species).|This dataset is part of a broader initiative whereby the company EDP - Energias de Portugal S.A. will made available biodiversity data collected during impact assessment and biological monitoring studies.|1,600 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
