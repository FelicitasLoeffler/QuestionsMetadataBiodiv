Although the method has generally remained the same, changes and improvements have been made on a more detailed level based on newly acquired ecological knowledge. This method, which includes new information up to August 2009, is described in Boesveld et al. (2009).All species reported for the HabSlak project are checked by an expert from the Anemoon Foundation. Observations that are not checked by an expert are not included in the database. Observations without evidence are not accepted.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
