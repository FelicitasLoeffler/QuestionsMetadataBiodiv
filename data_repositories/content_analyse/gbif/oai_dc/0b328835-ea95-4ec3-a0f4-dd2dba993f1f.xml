Both studies provide information on the occurrence and location of 2147 plant species from the Paramo in this area. For the purpose of the GBIF data-publishing, vegetation releve data were converted into species occurrence data.|Purpose 1: Data in TurboVegPurpose 2: data converted to species occurrence.
