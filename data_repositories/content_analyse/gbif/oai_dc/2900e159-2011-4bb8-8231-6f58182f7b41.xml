The findings confirm that pine marten continues to recolonise its former range, including at four widely-spaced locations in southern Scotland, and now occurs close to some of Scotland's major urban areas. The data was collected as part of a survey by Scottish Natural Heritage and The Vincent Wildlife Trust.|250 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
