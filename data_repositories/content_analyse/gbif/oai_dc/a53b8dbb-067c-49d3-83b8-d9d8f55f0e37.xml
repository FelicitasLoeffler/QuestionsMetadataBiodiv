As an ultimate goal, this field course intended to contribute to a global project that intends to uncover spider diversity patterns worldwide (see http://biodiversityresearch.org/research/biogeography/). With that purpose, we followed a set of standardized methods and procedures that allow the comparability of obtained data with numerous other samples being conducted across all continents. By doing so we guarantee that this data will be reused for multiple future projects currently being implemented.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
