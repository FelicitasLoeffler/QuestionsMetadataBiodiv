The collection, containing over 1,800 strains, has been built over decades with inputs from Australian wineries, microbial strain development programs at the AWRI, and by sourcing reference strains from other culture collections. The AWMCC is a very valuable resource to Australian wine producers, and is mined by the AWRI to isolate yeast strains that have novel characteristics of importance to winemakers.The collection was established in 1955 and continues to the present.Any request for physical supply from the Australian Wine Research Institute Ltd of strains of yeast and bacteria in the database will be subject to the Australian Wine Research Institute Ltd&amp;#39,s standard terms and conditions.|2,261 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
