Clark. However the WAD is complimented by numerous other echinoderm compendia (e.g., Clark &amp;amp, Downey&amp;#039,s Starfishes of the Atlantic, Rowe &amp;amp, Gate&amp;#039,s Zoological Catalogue of Australia, etc) and will eventually include all subsequent taxonomic changes and newly described taxa. Data have been contributed to the Catalogue of Life via the WoRMS, hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
