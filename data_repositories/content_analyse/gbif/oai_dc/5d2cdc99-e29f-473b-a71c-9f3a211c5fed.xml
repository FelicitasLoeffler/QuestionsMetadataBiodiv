Lesima (Northern Apennines) and it is the first record for the Lombardy region. C. homalisinus is a rare orophilous species: it has a discontinuous chorology that may  have been caused by glaciers dynamics during the Pleistocene era. Little is known about the  ecology of the species. This record and the expert-based investigation we performed determined that C. homalisinus inhabits shrublands and grasslands, but may also occur in the forests. This survey includes the only record of C. homalisinus foraging on flowers, a behavior that is not rare in the family Elateridae. We hypothesize that adults integrate their  diet with flower resources according to a generalist strategy.|1 occurrence</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
