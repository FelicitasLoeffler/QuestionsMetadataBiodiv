Studies on biodiversity, acoustic and geophysics, hydrography, and seabird and cetacean observations were conducted.  A total of 15 823 km&#178; were surveyed with a multibeam echosounder and 1462 km of seismic profiles, using an ultra-high resolution parametric sounder. The depth ranged between 218 m at the outcrop in the South-eastern sector of Valdivia Bank and 3000 m in the southern part of our study. A total of 210 species of fish, 60 crustaceans and 32 cephalopods were recorded. Species diversity increased by depth and four assemblages by depth strata were found: shallower (200-300 m), slope (300 - 800 m), upper deep (800 - 1300 m), and deep (1300 - 2000 m).&lt;/p&gt;|1,716 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
