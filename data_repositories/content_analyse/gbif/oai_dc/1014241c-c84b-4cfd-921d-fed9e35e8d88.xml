A total of 19 separate locations were found to have current, recent or old signs of water vole activity, 8 of which were considered to have currently active water vole colonies. The dataset includes absence records. The distribution of water vole colonies and suitable habitat within the Beinn Eighe NNR had previously been largely unknown.|The aims of the water vole survey were to: Establish presence/absence of water voles along watercourses in the SNH Beinn Eighe NNR property, Assess the habitat quality for water voles along the same watercourses, Identify those water vole colonies considered to be at greatest risk of extinction. The findings were incorporated into a long-term management strategy for water vole conservation within the NNR.|167 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
