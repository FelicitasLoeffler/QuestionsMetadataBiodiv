The protocol helps to determine what from a legal standpoint a reasonable amount of effort is to spend on a specific location. This is especially useful for expert bat researchers and bat research assessors.The protocol combines existing knowledge about prime field conditions, survey periods and the number and length of field visits. The protocol does not indicate the conditions in which bats are likely to occur, but the conditions in which the bats are most likely to be observed.The protocol has been developed to conduct effective research for the Flora and Fauna Act. If the protocol is followed, this generally ensures that from a legal perspective a responsible effort has been made to check if species or functions of areas have been disrupted. Especially when the presence of an area s function or species needs to be excluded, research projects that follow the protocol should be satisfactory from a legal standpoint.Applying the protocol guarantees 2 things:The Rural Areas Department will not require additional inventory research with a dispensation request according to article 75 of the Flora and Fauna Act.The research will hold up during a legal procedure.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/17-504-vleermuisprotocol-2013/</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
