Only 1 square kilometre is water. The current city of Eindhoven was formed in 1920, when Eindhoven, then hardly bigger than its current centre, merged with the surrounding villages Strijp, Woensel, Gestel, Tongelre and Stratum. There are quite a few nature reserves between these former villages.Positive observations without protocolDataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nl45,281 records (March 2018)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
