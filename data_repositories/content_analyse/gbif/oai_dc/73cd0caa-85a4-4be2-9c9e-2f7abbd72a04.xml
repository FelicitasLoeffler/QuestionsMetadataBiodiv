This project aims to inventory all plants that occur in the wild per square kilometre of land.The species that are found are counted on a FLORON tally list. When a key species is found, an estimation is made of how many specimens are present. Although the method has been adjusted over the years, such inventory surveys have been carried out since the beginning of the previous century. This is how the development of Dutch flora is studied. In order to develop an accurate picture of Dutch flora within a 10-year period, a fixed set of square kilometre plots, or selection plots, are prioritised. These are the backbone of the new data set.Apart from these selection plots, other square kilometre plots are also examined, preferably in areas for which there is no inventory data.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.5,367,369 records (March 2018)https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/12-001-totaalproject-floron/</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
