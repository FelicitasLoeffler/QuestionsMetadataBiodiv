Greenshank (Tringa nebularia) are sensitive to human land use activities such as aforestation and their breeding range is thought to have contracted, with an associated decline in breeding numbers, since 1980.  However, Greenshank numbers in the Outer Hebrides are thought to have increased considerably, with breeding being confirmed on the Shetland islands for the first time in 1980.  Despite the extensive study of the Greenshank breeding behaviour this was the first ever national survey of this species.  The survey was funded by the RSPB, JNCC and SNH through the Statutory Conservation Agencies RSPB Annual Breeding Birds Scheme (SCARABBS) programme.|101 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
