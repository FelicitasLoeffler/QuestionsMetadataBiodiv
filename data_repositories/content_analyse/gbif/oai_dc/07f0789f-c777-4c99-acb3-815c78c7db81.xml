It includes all data of bathynellids (Crustacea: Syncarida) collected in the last 48 years on the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands. It also includes specimens studied across much of Europe, as well as some specimens obtained from samples of North America, Asia, Africa and Australia. The samples come from groundwater (caves, springs, wells and hyporrheic habitat associated rivers) obtained from both, sampling campaigns and occasional sampling efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data set includes 3399 records (2657 slices and 742 DNA extracts) corresponding to three families (Parabathynellidae, Leptobathynellidae and Bathynellidae) of the order Bathynellacea, 52 genera and 92 species formally described,  plus around 30 additional taxa in study and, thus, still unpublished. This represents more than half of all the genera known worldwide and almost a third of the species currently known in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dataset contains a specially relevant collection that includes holotypes and type series of 43 new species of Bathynellacea. This dataset has been created and reviewed by a specialist in the group (Ana I. Camacho), and each specimen, regardless of its shape, includes taxonomic, geographical and authorship information.&lt;/p&gt;|3,399 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
