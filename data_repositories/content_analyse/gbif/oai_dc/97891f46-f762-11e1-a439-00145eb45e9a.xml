LSU 2.2 comprises four discrete lithologic beds. The upward sequence is informally referred to as the lower sand bed, diamicton bed, middle sand bed, and upper sand bed and it is surmised that these four units are closely related in time. The lower sand bed (~1.5m), which overlies lower Miocene sediments and from which it is separated by the Ross Sea Unconformity, contains traces of recycled Miocene diatoms but is otherwise barren of biogenic material. The diamicton bed (~2.42 m) contains 21 species of benthic foraminifera, with assemblages consistently dominated by Cassidulinoides porrectus, Ammoelphidiella antarctica, Rosalina cf. globularis, Cibicides refulgens, and Ehrenbergina glabra. The overlying middle sand bed (~1.9 m) contains 13 species. with C. porrectus and E. glabra dominant and A. antarctica less common than in the underlying diamicton bed. The upper sand bed (~0.46 m) contains four species and very few tests. The diamicton bed and middle sand bed assemblages are considered to be near in situ thanatocoenoses, and sediments interpreted as marine in origin but influenced by hyposaline waters and nearby ice. Planktic taxa are absent, perhaps indicating the presence of tidewater glaciers, sea ice and/or hyposaline surface waters. The small assemblage in the upper sand bed is more problematic and may be recycled. On the basis of foraminifera in the diamicton and middle sand beds. LSU 2.2 is assigned to the Pliocene. The overlying diamicton in LSU 2.1 contains abundant Quaternary foraminifera.|119 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
