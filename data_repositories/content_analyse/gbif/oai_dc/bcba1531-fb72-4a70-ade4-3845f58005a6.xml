The date range for the dataset is 1970-2009 but the majority of records are from the last 10 years. Recording effort varies widely between reserves, for some reserves this dataset gives a comprehensive record of Odonata species present but other reserves have few or no records. It is hoped that ongoing data review work will facilitate the addition of further records to this dataset.|8,851 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
