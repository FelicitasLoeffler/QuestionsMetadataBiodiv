A small number of records which require additional validation checks or where there is a particularly low confidence in the accuracy of the record have been excluded. There may also be some records on paper that have not yet been added to the electronic database.|The records are the result of casual observations and do not represent any kind of stematic survey effort. The records aid our understanding of the distribution, abundance and behaviour of Ephemeroptera across Derbyshire.|101 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
