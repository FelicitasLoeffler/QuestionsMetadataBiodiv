The collections are made up of contributions from a range of individuals. The quality of the data varies dependant on the original collector and the grid references for most of the older records have necessarily been inferred by museum staff. The records cover the whole of the UK including Ireland, although the majority of records originate from Staffordshire. They include the 'Wattison collection' - 181 dried shells of land and freshwater gastropods and  freshwater bivalves collected in north Staffordshire mainly between 1908 - 1911 by John T.
