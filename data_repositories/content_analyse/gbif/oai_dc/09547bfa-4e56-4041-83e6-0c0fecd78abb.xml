The ecologic quality of the Larraun river was analysed between 1996 and 1998 to assess the impact caused by the building of a new road and industrial activities: water quality, habitat, macroinvertebrates and fish community. The river presented organic pollution near towns and high nitrite levels. Data about fish biometry, age and feeding are given in the study. Some years later, the river was sampled to analyse the evolution of the fish populations after the building of the road.|The aim of the present data set is to provide all information of the records of freshwater fishes gathered in the research project carried by Dr. Oscoz about the biology and ecology of several species of freshwater fishes in the Larraun river, Navarra, Spain.|13,912 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
