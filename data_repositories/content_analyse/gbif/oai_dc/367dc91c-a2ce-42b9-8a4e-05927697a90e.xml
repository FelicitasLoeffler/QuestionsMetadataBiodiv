This can enhance poverty alleviation among cocoa farming households and biodiversity conservation while providing safe wildlife corridors and mitigating climate change effectsIt is believed that promoting high diversity shaded cocoa agroforests offers an opportunity for diversifying farmer income through diversified farm products and carbon trading. This provides an extra economic incentive to cocoa farming thereby protecting ecosystem health and improving agricultural sustainability.The study was carried out in ten (10) communities randomly selected from the communities within the range of the proposed Ankasa-Bia-Krokosua ecological corridor in the Western region of Ghana.|The purpose of this dataset is make biodiversity information available to decision makers. The data was mobilized and published under the Africa Biodiversity Challenge 2018 coordinated by SANBI and funded by JRS Biodiversity Foundation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
