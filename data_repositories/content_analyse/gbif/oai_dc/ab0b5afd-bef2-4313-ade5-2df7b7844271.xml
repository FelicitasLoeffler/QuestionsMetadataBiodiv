All mainland Portuguese provinces and all districts but one (&#201;vora) were investigated. A total of 761 dolichopodid samples were collected in 278 sampling sites distributed over 87 municipalities and 182 localities, with nearly &#190; of the samples gathered by sweepnet. In terms of generic representation, the Portuguese dolichopodid fauna occupies an intermediate position between those of northwestern European and other Mediterranean countries. Despite the large amount of data gathered, the dolichopodid fauna of Portugal remains insufficiently known and a considerable number of additional known and new species can be expected with continued sampling. A more exhaustive description of the dataset and the results of the surveys can be found in Pollet et al. (2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have released this dataset to the public domain under a CC-BY licence.
