Previous investigations of Pacific Coast sediments have been largely restricted to Pacific Northwest locales. Some important studies include those by Gray (1964), Wolfe, Hopkins, and Leopold (1966), Wolfe and Leopold (1967), Hopkins (1968), Piel (1969, 1977), Ballog, Sparks, and Waloweek (1972), and Musich (1973). The only published study of southern California materials is that of Heusser (1978) on Holocene sediments of the Santa Barbara basin. Most of these studies are concerned with the microflora from a particular formation, thus they have limited stratigraphic value and in most cases involve nonmarine to marginal marine rocks where no planktonic zonation was available. Musich's (1973) study was the first attempt at tying pollen assemblages to a planktonic zonation over an extended stratigraphic interval (Miocene to Pleistocene).Its location in the southern California Borderland and the sedimentary sections sampled make Leg 63 extremely valuable in deciphering the palynologic history of the Pacific Coast Neogene. Site 467 was chosen for our initial detailed study, because the relatively slow sedimentation rate provides an almost complete Neogene sequence of mainly terrigenous sediments and reliable planktonic age control is available.The goals of this study were to: (1) establish a reference section of Neogene palynomorph assemblages, (2) develop biostratigraphic criteria for use in correlation with other localities, (3) correlate the palynologic assemblages with the planktonic zonations, and (4) study the paleoenvironmental history in the southern California Neogene.|1,769 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
