Phase 1 of the project focused on developing validated and verified checklists of countries that are Party to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Phase 2 which is on-going, aims to achieve global coverage including non-party countries and all overseas territories of countries e.g. Netherlands, France and United Kingdom. Species belonging to all Kingdoms are covered as well as occurring in all Environment/systems. Country/ Territory/ Island checklists are reviewed and verified by networks of country or species experts. Verified checklists/ species records as well as those under review are presented on the online GRIIS website (www.griis.org). Individual species records are flagged with a &#8216;yes&#8217; for verification.  Only verified checklists/ species records are presented on the GBIF Portal.  This annotated checklist is of introduced (alien) and invasive alien species known to occur in Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal|The resource will be a support to countries to make progress to achieve Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 -in the development of their National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans, their National Invasive Alien Species Strategy and Action Plan, target setting and monitoring.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
