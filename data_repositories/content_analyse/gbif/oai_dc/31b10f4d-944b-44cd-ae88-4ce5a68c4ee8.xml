The two sexes are chromatically quite similar. The male has the same conspicuous banding pattern in the forewing as that of the female. The status of Calotelea tanugatra Narendran (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae) from India is reviewed and is proposed to be a junior synonym of Calliscelio elegans, new synonymy. Distribution of C. elegans in India is mapped.|7 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
