The specimens represent the permanent material evidence of knowledge on what plants occur in Tasmania, their distribution in space and time, their variability and a wealth of other information. They are also the raw materials for further discovery and knowledge of Tasmania&#8217;s unique flora.The collection underpins a wide range of plant-based activities, including:    plant identification and classification,    scientific studies and publications,    land-use, resource management and flora conservation activities,    ecological studies,    control and management of exotic flora,    control and management of prohibited plants,    the search for economically useful plants and plant products,    interpretations, displays and other presentations that promote TMAG and Tasmanian natural history to a wide audience.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
