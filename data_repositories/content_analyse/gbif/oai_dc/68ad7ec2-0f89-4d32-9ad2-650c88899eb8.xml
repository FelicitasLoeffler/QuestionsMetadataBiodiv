The data has been collated into 2 datasets for NBN (Sensitive and non-sensitive species) with the original survey name as an attribute. More detailed meta-data can be obtained for individual surveys on request from the centre.  Currently Sensitive species includes all bats, badgers and all birds of prey. Some data has been excluded altogether from these datasets until such time as we can clarify our authority to distribute it but this can be obtained directly from the trust.|YWT works as part of the Yorkshire and Humber Environmental Data Network to support local land management decision making and to develop baseline information to support things like Climate Change Action Planning.|109,075 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
