Strickland Entomological Museum houses approximately one million specimens. The research collection includes principally Nearctic insects, representing most orders and the major families thereof. The beetle family Carabidae is especially well represented: included are about 400,000 specimens mainly from the Nearctic region, but with an important Neotropical component, and fewer taxa from the remaining biogeographic regions of the world. The moths and butterflies, order Lepidoptera, with over 65,000 specimens, about half of which are from Alberta localities, are another group of major interest.|342,135 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
