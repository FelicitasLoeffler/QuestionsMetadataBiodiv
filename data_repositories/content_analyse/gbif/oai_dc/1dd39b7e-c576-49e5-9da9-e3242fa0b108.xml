On his exploring expeditions to North and East Africa as well as to South West Asia he documented his findings by diary entries (mostly lost) and hand drawings, of which the latter are housed at the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin. These drawings have been taxonomically revised and databased for scientific use.|624 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
