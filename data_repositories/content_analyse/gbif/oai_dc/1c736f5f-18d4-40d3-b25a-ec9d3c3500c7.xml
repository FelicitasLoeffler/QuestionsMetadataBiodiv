This dataset contains all the records we hold, apart from any acquired since our last NBNA upload.  Records from all taxonomic groups are accepted.  Taxonomic coverage is uneven but we make constant efforts to redress the balance by targeting under-recorded groups.|The records were collected for personal interest and/or with a view to adding to the Group's knowledge of species distribution in the area. This dataset is produced to make that knowledge more widely available.|96,282 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
