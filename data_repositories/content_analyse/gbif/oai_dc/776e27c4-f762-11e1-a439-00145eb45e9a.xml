Oxygen isotope ratios in tests of the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber allow us to assign the cores to oxygen isotope stages 7-1.Past sea-surface temperatures (SST) were estimated qualitatively using the composition of three Gephyrocapsa coccolith morphotypes, the high-, intermediate- and low-angel types that are classified based on the bridge angle of coccolith, can be used as proxies for warm, intermediate and cold temperature, respectively. Abundance of the high-angel type coccoliths increased and decreased during the interglacial and glacial periods, respectively. This tendency is consistent with the expected change of the Western Pacific Warm Pool (WPWP) development. However, a large shift in the abundance of the high-angle type coccolith recorded during early stage 3 did not correspond to the oxygen isotope record. The ratio of small (&lt;2.5 &#181;m) placoliths of Reticulofenetsra and Gephyrocapsa to the low-photic species was higher during stage 2 than late stage 3 and 1. As the reduced blanketed effect to the WPWP would cause an increase in the number of small placoliths, a reduction of the WPWP in stage 2 is indicated by the increase of small placoliths and by the lower SST deduced from the composition of the Gephyrocapsa morphotypes. The decreasing trend of small placoliths after ~40 ka is similar to the results reported in several previous studies in the surrounding regions of Australia.|2,535 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
