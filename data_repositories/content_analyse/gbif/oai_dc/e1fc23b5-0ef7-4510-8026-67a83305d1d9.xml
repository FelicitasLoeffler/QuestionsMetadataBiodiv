This research aims at a better knowledge of the forest in order to contribute to its sustainable management. To achieve this goal we set 30 plots of 0.25 ha following a systematic sample of rectangular stitches measuring 100 x 200m, in the forest. In each plot, we measured dendrometric parameters such as diameter at 1.3m above the soil and the total height of the trees. Also, the regeneration of valuable species has been counted in 3 squares plots of 100 m2 in each main plot.|498 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
