In addition 120 samples were taken in June 1966 to investigate the general pattern of distribution. Two species of the offshore fauna were found to dominate the lagoon (high population densities): Cribrononion articulatum and Miliammina fusca. The 'Vegetation zone' of the lagoon contains an assemblage of seven euryhaline arenaceous species. All of them were previously recorded from different regions of the world. - C. articulatum seems to prefer shallow water with a high daily range of water temperature (up to 30&#176; Cels.). Population density and distribution show considerable differences between the different years. Size distribution curves of C. articulatum indicate main reproduction activity in spring and subsequent growth in uniform populations. Growth is terminated after six months but most of the specimens will either die in winter or reproduce the next spring, only a smaller amount is reproducing in summer or autumn. - Annual differences of the observed degree make it difficult to calculate foraminiferal productivity in a lagoonal environment and require seasonal observation over a period of at least 3 or 4 years.|797 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
