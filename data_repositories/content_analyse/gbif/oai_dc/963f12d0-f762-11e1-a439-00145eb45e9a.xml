There are an estimated 3,000 type specimens. The collection is particularly rich in ferns, bryophytes and grasses, as well as in historically important materials from early botanical collectors. In addition, it was the herbarium of record for the flora of southern New England from 1864 until 1955, when that function passed to the University of Connecticut at Storrs.|151,132 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
