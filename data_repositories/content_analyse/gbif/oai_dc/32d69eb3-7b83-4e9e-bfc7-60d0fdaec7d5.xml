Similarly Arabian Sea sediments are hotspots for microbial diversity and therefore requires a detailed investigation. Bacterial diversity profiles of marine metagenome were brought to light by the present studies based on Illumina sequencing trageting the V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene, revealing the roles of different bacteria in nutrient cycling and organic matter degradation. The analysis also revealed the existence of many unknown sequences, indicating a large untapped bacterial diversity in these areas.|1,208 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
