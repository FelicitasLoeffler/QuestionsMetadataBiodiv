These mountains support forest and some grassland and heathland vegetation, although large areas have been converted from natural vegetation to agriculture and plantations. There is a chain of somewhat similar montane forest areas extending from southern Tanzania to Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. However, these more southern forests are not so directly under the Indian Ocean climatic regime, are subject to more variable convectional rainfall patterns, and the forests do not possess the species richness and endemism of the Eastern Arc. Together, the Eastern Arc and these other montane forest areas comprise the Tanganyika-Nyasa Mountain Forest Group.|2,084 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
