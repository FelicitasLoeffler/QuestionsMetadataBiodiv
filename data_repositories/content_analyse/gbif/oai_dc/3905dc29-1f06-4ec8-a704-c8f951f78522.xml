A total of 534 specimens have been collected in the area from 1932-2017. Some collections of 1932-1972 were collected in areas which already had the indigenous natural vegetation typical of east African coastal biome, but currently such vegetation has completely been lost and replaced with farmlands and human settlement areas, thus not suitable for supporting the coastal species like the Golden-rumped Sengi (Rhynchocyon chrysopygus). Hence, the collection data can be used to inform on the changes in the size of ASF overtime, as result of anthropogenic activities around it and how it consequently affects the distribution of species conserved in this forest.|534 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
