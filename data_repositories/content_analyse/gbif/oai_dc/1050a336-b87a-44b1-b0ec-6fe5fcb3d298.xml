The collection is scientifically valuable for its extensive coverage of this rich and biogeographically complex transitional region. The majority of specimens are fluid-preserved and are accompanied by field notes. There are significant holdings of amphibian eggs and larvae, skeletal preparations, prepared materials, focused collections that show evolutionary dynamics at intraspecific transition zones, and the synoptic collection. We do not maintain a tissue collection at this time.  The CCBER herpetological collection is unique in its thorough coverage of the herpetofauna of southwestern California, and for its relevance to critical conservation issues via documenting life history patterns of declining amphibians and recent changes in the abundance and distribution of species.|15,637 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
