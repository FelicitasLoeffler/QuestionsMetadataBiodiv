As much as 25 dfferent species encompassing 14 genera and eight families were identified and their records are discussed herein.The collection is archived in the Marine Invertebrate Collection of the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). The majority (69%) of specimens are from the Nymphon australe group (Nymphonidae), although species richness and abundance variedamong the stations sampled. The collection includes several specimens from polymerous taxa, Pentanymphon antarcticum (Nymphonidae), Decolopoda australis (Colossendeidae)and Pentapycnon bouvieri (Pycnogonidae). All species were classified based on morphological characters, and DNA sequences (from the 18S, 12S, 16S and COI regions) for 21 of the representative morphotypes are given. The DNA sequences confirmed the species-level distinctiveness of these morphotypes.|104 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
