This is part of a larger dataset collected by volunteers from the Scheme. The data were either received on recording cards and input in BRC (2004-5) or were sent in electronic format from the scheme organisers. Non-cranefly species are also present in the dataset. An update was made to the dataset in summer 2006 to include another 41000 records from the Cranefly Recording Scheme.|The reasons for data collection were to determine the national distribution and status of the fauna, including the ecology governing those factors. From the official launch of the scheme in 1973, the relevance to conservation and ecological assemblages/habitat management was seen as a high motivation.|137,398 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
