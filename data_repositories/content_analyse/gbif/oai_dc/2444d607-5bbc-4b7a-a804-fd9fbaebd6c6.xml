The study sites are within the protected areas of the Natural Parks of the Diputaci&#243; de Barcelona and in other river reaches with reference conditions of the province of Barcelona. The main objective of the project is to examine whether global environmental changes are affecting the structure of these ecosystems. The collection includes specimens collected in spring and summer from 2012 to 2016. Specimens of macroinvertebrates, are sorted and identified at family (29%),genus (42%) and species (11%) level. The macroinvertebrates have been fixed in formaldehyde and preserved in 70% ethanol in 5mL vials. This project is the continuation of the first river quality monitoring studies that started back in 1979, which data will soon be included in GBIF as well. On the other hand, as the project has continuity in the future, this collection will grow year by year.|5,979 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
