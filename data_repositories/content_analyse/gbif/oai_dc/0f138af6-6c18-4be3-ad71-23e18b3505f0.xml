The features of the local dynamics of the population are determined both by the intensity of its reproduction at the reproductive habitats and by the intensity of subsequent migrations. A comparison of the data available on the seasonal dynamics of the intertidal harpacticoids at various latitudes allows one to suggest that they are mainly determined by the temperature regime.&lt;/p&gt;|149 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
