The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;Ecosystem services like pollination are affected by a variety of factors in agricultural used landscapes. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of land use intensity, local management and landscape context on the abundance and diversity of flower visiting wild bees and hoverflies.|1,748 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
