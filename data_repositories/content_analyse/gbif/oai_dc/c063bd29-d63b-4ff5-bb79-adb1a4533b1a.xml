The reference collection has been created in order to be a referential of marine species of the Azores, both common and rare. Thus, new occurrences could be compared with new ones. Therefore, material in the collection can be useful for new scientific and taxonomic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specimens collected in the Azores (few collected in Madeira island and near seamounts) from 1977 to 2012. The collection consists mostly of preserved animals, however few specimens from other groups are also present. Preserved specimens consists of organisms inhabiting coastal areas until the deep-sea. All are marine species, except for one terrestrial record. &lt;br/&gt;The specimens were collected by different persons and from different sources: during research cruises or scientific field work, by commercial or recreational fishermen, coastal and beach strandings, donations, etc. Most of the specimens are preserved in formalin, but other preservation methods, such as dry, alcohol and frozen, are also used according to the preserved specimen.&lt;/p&gt;|7,270 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
