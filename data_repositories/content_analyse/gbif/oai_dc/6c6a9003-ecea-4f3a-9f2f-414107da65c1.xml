The dataset includes information of the forest structure (diameter size, tree height and abundance) of the Quercus pyrenaica ecosystem in Sierra Nevada obtaided from 199 transect sampled at the treeline ecotone, mature forest and marginal habitats (abandoned cropland and pine plantations). A total of 3839 occurence records were collected and 5751 measurement recorded. The dataset is included in the Sierra Nevada Global-Change Observatory (OBSNEV), a long-term research project designed to compile socio-ecological information on the major ecosystem types in order to identify the impacts of global change in this area.|3,839 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
