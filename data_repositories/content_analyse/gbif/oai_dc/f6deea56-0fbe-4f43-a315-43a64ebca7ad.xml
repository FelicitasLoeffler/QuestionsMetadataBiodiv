Section 545-73-1 yielded a marine palynoflora of Sinemurian-Bajocian age. A palynoflora of nonmarine origin and assigned a Rhaetian-Hettangian age was recovered from halite in Section 546-18-2. Marine palynofloras of Hettangian-early Pliensbachian age were recovered from Sample 547B-24-CC to Section 547B-14-2. Sections 547B-28-1 to 547B-25-3 yielded impoverished nonmarine palynofloras to which only a general Rhaetian-Hettangian age could be given.|138 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
