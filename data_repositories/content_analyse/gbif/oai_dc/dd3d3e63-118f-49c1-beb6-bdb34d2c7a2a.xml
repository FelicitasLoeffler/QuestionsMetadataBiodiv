The scheme covers 30 specific indicators including both individual species and groups of similar species. All indicators have been through a selection process to ensure they are easy to recognize and difficult to miss. The species are quite common and easy to spot in Denmark. Indicators are also selected to respond to the main threats to the Danish environment. As a consequence, no verification is conducted of the observations. Data is collected as a list where the collector can select between 0 and 30 of the indicators observed on one trip. There is no protocol for how to conduct surveys. A dedicated mobile APP has been developed for the scheme as well as an online registration module for computers. Time and locations is recorded either through the build in services in the mobile device (APP) or through google earth (computer).|52,612 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
