The DFDE has been elaborated by Alterra and European Forest Institute.  The dataset shared here contains a subset of the data for occurrence of biotic agents only, i.e., mammals, insects and fungi.  Abiotic agents are not included in this dataset. Also full information on the extent of damage has been excluded. The dataset here has been georeferenced automatically using GeoLocate and the geographic coordinates have been checked only where so indicated.  Please report corrections to the resource contact. Look for www.efi.int to access the entire database.  The content of the database has been last updated in 2002. Future updates are possible -- please indicate interest in such project.|6,628 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
