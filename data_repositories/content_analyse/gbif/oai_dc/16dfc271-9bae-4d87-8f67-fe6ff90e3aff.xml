The MBON Pole to Pole aims to become a key resource for decision-making and management of living resource across countries in the Americas for reporting requirements under the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), Aichi Targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).This collection corresponds to the species registered on intertidal rocky shores of Massachusetts, using the MBON Pole to Pole sampling protocol for Rocky Shores, with funding from the National Science Foundation (OCE-1635989)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
