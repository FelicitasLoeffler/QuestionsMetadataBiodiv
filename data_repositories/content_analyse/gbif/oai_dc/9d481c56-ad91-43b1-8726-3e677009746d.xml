This survey was designed to provide lek distribution, and a count of lekking birds, expanding on the areas covered by smaller surveys in 2006, 2007 and 2008. This dataset contains all the positive records, some of which are multiple counts of the same birds. Hence, the sum of birds in this dataset does not match with the reported total of 230 leking males. Some data are omitted due to a confidentiality agreement with the land owner.  The survey was conducted by the Southern Upland Partnership, which is supported by SNH, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Leader, and the RSPB.|210 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
