The Observatories&#8217; primary objective includes the promotion of bird conservation and education in Costa Rica through scientific monitoring.Humans and birds depend on intact ecosystems for food resources, shelter and other broad environmental processes such as carbon sequestration and atmospheric regulation. Human enterprise routinely degrades ecosystems causing the global decline of many bird populations. To manage and conserve bird species in peril we must identify factors preventing population-level recovery, thereby moving beyond estimates of mere population size to demographics and to the underlying causes of population changes.|27,290 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
