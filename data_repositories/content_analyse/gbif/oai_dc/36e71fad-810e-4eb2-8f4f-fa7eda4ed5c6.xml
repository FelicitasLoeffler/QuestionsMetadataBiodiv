Nevertheless, all macrofauna &gt;1mm was identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benthic samples were collected in September-October 1998 on the N.O. Georges Petit along the portion of coast between the Spanish-French border and the mouth of the Rh&#244;ne River. This section of coast spans about 110 km from South to North and 140 km from West to East. Sampling sites were located on 21 inshore-offshore transects. Most (i.e., 16) transects were sampled at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 m depth. Transects O, P, Q, S and U were only sampled at 10, 20 and 30 m depth. In addition, the transect F was not sampled at 30 m depth. Sediment samples were collected with a 0.1 m&#178; van Veen grab. At each site, 3 grabs were taken for the analyses of benthic macrofauna, and 1 for granulometric and organic content analyses. Macrofauna samples were immediately sieved on a 1 mm mesh and the fauna retained were fixed in 5% formalin. At the laboratory, samples were sorted were later identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level and counted. Unidentified species were only taken into account when they could not be mistaken for other identified species. Granulometric analysis was conducted on fresh sediment using a Coulter&#174; LS Particle Size Analyzer. Organic carbon was measured after acidification (HCl 1N) of freeze-dried sediment using a CHN Perkin Elmer&#174; 2400 analyzer.&lt;/p&gt;|5,642 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
