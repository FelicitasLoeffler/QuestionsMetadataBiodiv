Extending over 2400 km nearly east-west with complex topographical features Himalaya provides a wide variety of climate and soils and consequently supports a remarkable assemblage of vegetation types and vascular plant diversity. In this database we examined all available 31 floras published in 42 volumes for different regions of Bhutan, Nepal and Indian Himalayan states and compiled a comprehensive checklist of all plants reported from Himalaya with information on their geographical and elevational distribution. The species names of vascular plants were assessed against updated taxonomic list of botanical names available from www.theplantlist.com (The Plant List, 2013). Further all names were assessed in the GBIF backbone taxonomy using species matching service on GBIF website.|26,734 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
