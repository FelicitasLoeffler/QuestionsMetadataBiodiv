Records for fungi, lichens and bryophytes are now being posted to the taxon-specific networks. The geographic focus of the Intermountain Herbarium is the Intermountain Region of western North America but its holdings come from many different countries. It even has one or more specimens from each of the seven continents. The collection is particularly rich in the Scrophulariaceae (traditional sense) and grasses, including voucher specimens of plants used by by the late D.R. Dewey in his cytogenetic studies of the Triticeae.|169,627 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
