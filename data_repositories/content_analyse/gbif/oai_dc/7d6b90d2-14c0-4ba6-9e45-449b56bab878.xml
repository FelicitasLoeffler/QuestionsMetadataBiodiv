Between 2013 and 2018, two sampling campaigns were conducted on Terceira island ("TER_13-15" survey) and on Terceira and Pico islands ("TER-PIC_18" survey) aimed to study the ecology of introduced mammals. A third sampling campaign was performed between 2015 and 2017 sampling was performed in vineyards on Terceira island in order to evaluate grape consumption by vertebrates species ("Vineyards_15-17" survey). Additionally, between 2016 and 2018, two sampling campaigns were performed in Terceira island, in order to assess the impact of introduced mammals on native birds, on Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis, "Calonectris_16" survey) and the Azores woodpigeon (Columba palumba azorica, "Columba_17-18" survey), through nest predation monitoring. A total of 258 sites and 47 nests were sampled using camera traps. These sampling campaigns provided a large data series that allowed create a vertebrate wildlife inventory of Azores|108,186 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
