Much of the collection was transferred to NC State in the late 1990s when we lost our museum space to renovations for research space. We have recently rebuilt some of what remained to a somewhat larger collection, due to our own collecting and a decent sized gift of Costa Rican, European and North American butterflies. The collection is an idiosyncratic collection of what was left behind, what I&#8217;ve collected, and butterflies gifted to the College.|6,528 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
