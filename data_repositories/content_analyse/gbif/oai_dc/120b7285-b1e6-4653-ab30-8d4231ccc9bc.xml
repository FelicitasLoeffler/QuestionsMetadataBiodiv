All the survey data were collected by volunteers and compiled by the late Peter Twinn, formally the national scheme organiser. The recording cards were input to electronic format in BRC and an atlas was published in 1999 with text compiled by Paul Harding. Recording for the scheme is continuing under new leadership, with Martin Rejzek and Peter Hodge currently collating new records.
