The collection provides excellent coverage in ethnobotanical notes and houses vouchers for the Flora Ontario Integrated Botanical Information System (FOIBIS). The collection also contains DNA Barcoding vouchers for the Center for Biodiversity Intitute of Ontario (CBG) of the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario. BIO Herbarium is committed to making this important collection more accessible to botanists and others, wherever they may be, for use in their own projects: particularly in biodiversity, conservation, sustainable development and systematics. To this end we have developed HIMS, which contains labelled information and images of all the specimens at the BIO Herbarium.|65,535 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
