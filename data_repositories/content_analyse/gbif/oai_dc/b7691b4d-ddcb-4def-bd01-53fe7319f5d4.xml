Assessments of species composition, distribution, abundance and size composition of larval lamprey (ammocoetes and transformers) populations in these river are of particular interest as an indication of Condition Assessment. The data was collected to help assess the conservation status of Lampreys in the Usk and Wye Catchments.  This collation of lamprey data is made up of data collected by Countryside Council for Wales (CCW) and the Environment Agency Wales for CCW SAC monitoring reports or CCW Review of Consents reports.   The collation includes information about species distribution, composition and abundance for river, brook and sea lampreys which are a designated (Annex II) features within SAC rivers in Wales. The majority of the data was recorded at the genus level and no distinction was made between river and brook lampreys. However for some historical data no distinction was made between sea and river/brook lampreys and these were recorded at the family level.  This dataset comprises of a number of surveys entered into Recorder 6 which have been packaged for dissemination onto the NBN Atlas.|The data was collated to help show the distribution of Lamprey species in Welsh SACs and to aid the reporting requirements of the Habitats Directive by publishing this data on the NBN Atlas.|772 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
