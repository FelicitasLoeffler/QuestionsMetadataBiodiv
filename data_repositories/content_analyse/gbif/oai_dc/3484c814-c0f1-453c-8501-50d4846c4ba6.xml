This collection was displayed until the complete renovation of the permanent exhibition in 2011. Then, in 1989, the scientific and historical collection of Brother Firmin Lalibert&#233; was used as a starting point for the Insectarium&#8217;s scientific collections. The Insectarium&#8217;s scientific collections are composed of more than 225,000 insect specimens and include major specialized collections for certain taxa. They also offer a synoptic overview of Qu&#233;bec&#8217;s insects. Over the past five years, more than 900 type specimens have been put into the Insectarium&#8217;s scientific collections.|39,114 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
