This dataset is currently maintained and managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW). The surveys focus on benthic habitats (often referred to as 'biotopes') in intertidal, inshore (typically within 3 nm) and subtidal areas. Original copies of all the surveys are now held in NRW's Marine Recorder database.|The purpose of this data capture was to aid coastal zone and sea-use management and to contribute to the identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance.|179,940 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
