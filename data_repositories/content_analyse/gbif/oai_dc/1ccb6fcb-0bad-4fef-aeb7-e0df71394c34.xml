What is the current condition of the Dutch dragonflies and how can that be explained? We contribute to protecting the dragonflies in the Netherlands by identifying the causes affecting their condition.The data can also be used on a regional level. Observers participating in the monitoring program are given a guide that explains the method and includes instructions for the tally forms.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.214,286 records (March 2018)https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/7-201-landelijk-meetnet-libellen/</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
