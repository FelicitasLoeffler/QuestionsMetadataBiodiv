The data documents a lamprey survey conducted in 2012 as part of the Site Condition Monitoring programme for the designated site.|The purpose of this survey was to build upon the results of previous surveys undertaken (Forth Fisheries Foundation, 2004, Loch Lomond Fishery Trust, 2005, Hume, 2011, Watt et al., 2011) to determine the condition of the lamprey populations in the Endrick Water SSSI and SAC by providing a detailed description of the distribution and density of brook and river lamprey. This and the previous surveys also provided information on the presence of sea lamprey in the Endrick Water.|50 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
