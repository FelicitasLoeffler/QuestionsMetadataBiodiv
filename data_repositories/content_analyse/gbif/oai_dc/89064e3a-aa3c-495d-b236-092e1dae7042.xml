The electric fishing protocol of Pr&#233;vost and Baglini&#232;re (1995) is used. It targets Atlantic salmon young of the year (0+ parr), but older fish (juvenile salmon &#8805;1+) are also caught and included in this dataset. Sampling is restricted to areas with shallow running water flowing on coarse bottom substrate, i.e. the preferred habitat of young of the year salmon. The data consist of abundance indices and biological traits measured on the fish sampled: sex, maturity status, length, weight and age. The latter is ascertained from scale samples taken from the fish which size does not allow to determine their age unambiguously.|36,505 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
