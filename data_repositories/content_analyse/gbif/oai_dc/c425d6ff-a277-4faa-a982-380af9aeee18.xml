Founded  in 1967, the LPM Herbarium  contains over 250 vascular plant specimens, with a focus on plants found  in native tall grass prairie habitat. Many of the specimens were collected during surveys by the International Biological Program, which lead to the protection of the 12 hectare (30 acre) remnant tall grass prairie site that would become LPM. The establishment and registration of our digitized herbarium is an important step towards sharing the diversity of tall grass prairie species with the international community. This dataset represents the digitized vascular plant specimens collected mostly within the city of Winnipeg.|350 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
