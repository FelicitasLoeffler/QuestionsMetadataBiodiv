The mammals of the Galicica National Park and its surroundings were the main object of study, using various methods. Live traps were used to identify small mammals like shrews and mice. Data on bats was gathered with bat detectors and mistnets. Bat parasites and DNA material were collected from all bats captured and identified afterwards. Other mammal species were observed visually. While recording mammals, attention was given to insects (butterflies, dragonflies and grasshoppers), amphibians, reptiles and birds as well. Locations were recorded with GPS.|318 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
