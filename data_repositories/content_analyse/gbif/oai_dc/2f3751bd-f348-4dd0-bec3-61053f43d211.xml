The aim of the project was to determine the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The breeding status was derived from lapwing behaviour (adults behaving like they have young or lapwing flocks present), time of survey visit, and whether there were any young recorded.  On some visits breeding birds and a non breeding flock were both present on the same filed, these are recorded separately for accurate breeding status.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The sites were surveyed on a field by field basis. Transforming this site based data to be grid reference based means that some grid squares may hold more than one field, that were originally surveyed separately. This means that there may be a few records that have the same grid reference, and were recorded on the same day, these are not duplicates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Lapwings have suffered significant declines, primarily because of changes in farming practices, and are now red listed as a species of high conservation concern everywhere in the UK.|1,947 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
