Phase 2 woodland surveys have been carried out periodically since the late 1980s but a concentrated period of survey on SSSI and pSSSI woodland occurred from 1995 and 2000.|The purpose of this data capture was to improve the overall knowledge of Welsh woodland communities, to provide consistent community descriptions across the woodland SSSI series as fundamental site-support information and to assess SSSI status of new sites.|27,972 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
