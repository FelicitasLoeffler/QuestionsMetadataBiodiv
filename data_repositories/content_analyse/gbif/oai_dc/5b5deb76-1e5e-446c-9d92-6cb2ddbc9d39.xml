They are based on field records by Viktoria N. Pashkina performed in 2017&#8211;2018 using a grid scheme. Georeferences are based on WGS84 grid scheme with 24 grid squares (5 minutes lat. &#215; 10 minutes long., or ca. 116 square km). Dataset contains only one occurrence per species per grid square, thereby earlier records are not duplicated if they were confirmed later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dataset is a part of the Master's Paper "Spatial structure of flora in agricultural landscapes (based on case study of Samoylovsky District of Saratov Oblast)" (Pashkina, 2019) supervised by Dr. A.P. Seregin. Ca. 800 voucher specimens were trasfered to the Moscow University Herbarium and will be available via the "Moscow University Herbarium (MW)" dataset (https://www.gbif.org/dataset/902c8fe7-8f38-45b0-854e-c324fed36303).&lt;/p&gt;|5,772 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
