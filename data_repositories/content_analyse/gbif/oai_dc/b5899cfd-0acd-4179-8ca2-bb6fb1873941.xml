The data set represents a list of tissue samples and DNA extracts taken from live specimens and their haplotype for the 16S gene. The 16S rRNA sequences generated in this project have been submitted to GenBank to allow other researchers to access this information.|37 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
