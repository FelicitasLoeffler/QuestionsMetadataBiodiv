The purpose of this project was to find an identification method for cyprinids of the Iberian Peninsula using their bony structures (scales, cleithra and operculum) and use them to determine the size and body mass of these fish (Miranda 1997).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1000 individuals belonging to 26 species of cyprinidae family present in Spain were analysed. Description of anatomical features related with cleithra, opercula and scales morphology allowed the specific discrimination of individuals and the elaboration of an identification key for the family.&lt;/p&gt;|The aim of the present data set is to provide all information of the records of freshwater fishes related with the project thesis of Dr. Miranda. The purpose of this dataset is to provide the information of the skeletal structures of the 1199 specimens analysed that are stored in the facilities of the Museum MZNA. According to the project, these pieces provide stable morphological characters to differentiate most of the 26 species considered and to create dichotomous keys to identify them.|1,249 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
