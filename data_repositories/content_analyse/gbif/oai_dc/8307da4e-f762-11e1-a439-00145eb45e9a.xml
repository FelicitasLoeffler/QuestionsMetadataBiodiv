For these reason, bacteria have been the main target for worldwide biodiversity competitions to pre-occupy them, and the efforts to find out new bacterial strains are still made all over the world. But the chance to isolate and identify a new bacteria is getting more difficult to obtain nowadays, because not only the process is complicated but also there are huge informations to know about the existing bacteria to compare with coming new one.
