Though the Ministry of Forestry and Natural resources has intensified clean-up operations to get rid of illegal possession, vending and transportation of charcoal and other forest produce are on the increase. This has led to degrease in species being targeted for these forestry products. The present list documents some of the species which are targeted by charcoal and firewood sellers and their distribution. This distribution is not exhaustive enough as it doesn&#8217;t cover the entire distributional range of these species. The current list represents only samples that have been digitized in BRAHMS database. Digitization of records is an ongoing process and this list will be improved as more data is entered in the database.|352 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
