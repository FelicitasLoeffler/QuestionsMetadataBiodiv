The majority of records are based on the 1km National Grid covering Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, however, important sites are separately assessed. The work was carried out by surveyors experienced in plants, birds, freshwater life and general invertebrates and the species recorded reflect this. Each sample square, out of  a total of 116 squares, was explored on foot to attempt to obtain a fairly comprehensive species list. Much of the voucher material for the survey is housed at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery, Stoke-on-Trent.|The data collection was to produce an inventory of the biodiversity of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire and eventually to produce a series of publications about the natural history of Stoke-on-Trent, additionally many of the specimens were retained in the collections of the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery.|15,164 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
