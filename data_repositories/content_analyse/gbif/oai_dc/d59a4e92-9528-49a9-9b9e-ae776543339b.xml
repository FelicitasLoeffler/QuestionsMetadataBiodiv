Specifically, this dataset was used to look at population structure among putative breeding populations, the mixing of breeding populations on high latitude Antarctic feeding grounds and evidence for sex-specific migration along the eastern Australian migratory corridor.Australian Antarctic Data Centre Note, 2018-07-10:Original datasheet was reformatted to fit IPT Biodiversity.AQ standard. The new datasheet "humpbackWhales.csv" provides the dataset ID, decimal latitude and longitude, location, sex, occurrence, and date of event. The taxonomical organisation is provided to the lowest taxonomical rank that could be determined, after matched in WoRMS (World Register of Marine Species).|497 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
