James, published by the Hertfordshire Natural History Society in December 2009.|The data were compiled to enable the production of a new assessment of the vascular plant flora of Hertfordshire, including assessing changes since a similar survey was carried out in the 1960s (J.G.Dony, Flora of Hertfordshire (1967)).  The data were used to produce a new Flora of Hertfordshire (2009), as well as to form the basis for a Hertfordshire Vascular Plant Red Data List.  Summary (10km) data from the Survey were also supplied to the New atlas of the British &amp; Irish flora, published by the BSBI in 2002.|157,292 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
