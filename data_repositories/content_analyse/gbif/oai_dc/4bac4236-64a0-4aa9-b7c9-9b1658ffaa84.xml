The species best fits the "frontalis subgroup" of the "lalandii group" ofJasus lobsters. J. caveorum is most similar to J. frontalis from the eastern South Pacific, but differs clearly from that species in having very littleabdominal "squamous" sculpturing.|30 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
