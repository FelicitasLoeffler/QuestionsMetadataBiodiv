The list of INNS used was agreed with Natural Resources Wales. Records of other species are supplied in a separate dataset. Only records where specific permissions have been obtained from the dataset supplier are included. We have also excluded the following records: any which we believe to be already held on the NBN Atlas, any submitted to us by Biological Records Centre or a National Scheme/Society/Conservation organisation, and any owned by Natural Resources Wales (some of which are submitted by Cofnod within three separate datasets). This dataset may include Sensitive species records (as described in our Data Sourcing, Management and Use policy available from the Cofnod website).|Records will have been collected for many different reasons, but have been collated by Cofnod as part of our aim to bring together species records across North Wales. They have been made available here because this has been demonstrated to be a high priority for the UK Government.|16,724 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
