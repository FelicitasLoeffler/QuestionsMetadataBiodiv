It excludes species that colonized new locations naturally (so called &#8216;range extensions&#8217;), even if in response to climate change. The dataset is published as a standardized Darwin Core Archive and includes for each taxon: the scientific name, higher classification, stable identifiers linking to taxon and scientific name information, taxonomic status, and nomenclatural status, the vernacular names, the region of introduction and associated country, as well as the year of the first introduction (first collection) and/or last assessment/observation in this region, coarse habitat information, and the pathway(s) of introduction and invasion stage.We have released this dataset under a Creative Commons license  (CC-BY).
