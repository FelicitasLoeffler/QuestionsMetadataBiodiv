They are used to estimate basic parameters of commercial fish populations, including biomass, sex ratio, and the proportion of sexually mature fish, and the distribution of ages and lengths in the population. These parameters may be used in estimating mortality and growth rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dataset is a continuation of data from the NIWA/MPI Trawl database that was initially released as the New Zealand fish and squid distributions from research bottom trawls 1964-2008 available at https://nzobisipt.niwa.co.nz/resource?r=obisprovider&lt;/p&gt;|78,879 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
