Surveys are based on structured surveillance using standardised methodologies agreed with national species monitoring organisations (e.g. NARRS - amphibians, BDS - dragonflies, PSYM - invertebrate and plants, etc.). Ponds were selected based on a stratified random sample in addition to self-selected sites.|2,673 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
