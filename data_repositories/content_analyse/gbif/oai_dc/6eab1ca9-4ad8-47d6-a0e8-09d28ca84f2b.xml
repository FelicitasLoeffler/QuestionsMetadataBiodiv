The present list is based on a database built during a period of twenty years. The original information was derived from a published catalogue by Davies &amp;amp, Tobin (1984, 1985). However, original publications were consulted to check the spelling and original combination of (virtually) all names. The present taxonomic status of every name in this list is based on published authoritative sources. Addition of the names of fossil taxa, and setting up a management committee for this database, are to be expected in the near future. The original information of the GSD Odonata is managed using a FoxPro application.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
