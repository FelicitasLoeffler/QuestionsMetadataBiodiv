The Museum&#8217;s original collection was lost in a wildfire in 1978 and was then restarted in the early 1980&#8217;s.  The collection includes large sub-collections which were compiled by private collectors and donated to the museum. These include several collections composed of over 10000 specimens, such as the collections donated by the Mendo&#231;a family, Ant&#243;nio B&#237;var de Sousa and Passos de Carvalho. These contribute significantly to enhance the temporal and geographic coverage of the collection. The collection remains in constant growth (ca. 4,7% in 2018), as a substantial number of specimens are still on the process of sorting, preparation and cataloguing. Furthermore, since 2014 the collection data has been under intensive verification, enrichment and validation. Over 97% (39174 records) have now been validated.|Make the collection data acessible to the scientific community.|39,139 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
