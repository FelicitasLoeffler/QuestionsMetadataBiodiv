Sandy sediment samples were collected off Basiluzzo Islet (Panarea Island, Italy) both at CO2            venting areas and at CO2 not impacted area, and DNA was extracted from two different sediment layers (0-2 cm            and 4-6 cm). Bacterial communities was described using 454-Massively Parallel Tag Sequencing (454-MPTS).|5,088 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
