Stoneworts (or charophytes) are a group of algae that grow in fresh and brackish water and have a relatively complex structure.|Stoneworts are good indicators of water quality as they are sensitive to pollution, including nutrient enrichment. Many are of conservation importance. 30 species have been recorded in the UK and 17 of these occur in Wales. Of the latter, 4 are Red Data Book species, 6 are Nationally Scarce, and 9 are considered rare in Wales, 3 are Priority Species in the UK BAP and are included on the National Assembly of Wales' List of Species and Habitats of Principal Importance for the Conservation of Biological Diversity (Section 74 list).|1,496 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
