Lee herbarium of Seoul National University(SNUA) houses 80,000 vascular plants specimens, most of which were collected within south Korea. Our earliest specimens were collected in the 1960&#8217;s by T.B. Lee and during the first part of the 21st century by several researchers.  A recent focus of our collections is on the flora of woody plants in south Korea.The T.B. Lee Herbarium has used our own budget for the recording of collections using the BRAHMS database program.  All records will be published at the GBIF website. The number of georeferenced specimens is constantly growing. Collector&#8217;s name and collection date were added for 40% specimens in December 2018. 15,000 occurrences were georeferenced by the support of BIFA project &#8216;Data mining of historical herbarium specimens from the Korean peninsula&#8217;.Currently, T.B. Lee Herbarium is the only Korean biodiversity database with standardized names, gazetteers and georeference in the Korean peninsula.  It is the primary source for the &#8220;Distribution Atlas of the Korean peninsula Flora&#8221; and &#8220;Checklist of the Korea Flora&#8221; to be outworked in the Seoul National University in due time.|18,106 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
