It was distinguished from the Tasmanian G. gymnota (Scott 1977) by  the number of pored scales in the lower lateral line, the number of branches of the supraorbital tentacle, and the colouration of the pectoral-fin base.Examination of new material of G. signata from the Auckland  region, and re-examination  of type material of  G.  gymnota,  show  that  the  supraorbital  tentacle  and  lower  lateral  line  are  not differences  of taxonomic significance. Pectoral fin colouration in a published underwater photo of G. gymnota suggests that the colour difference was due to  the  effects  of preservation. We therefore refer G. signata to the synonymy of G. gymnota. This synonymy, in combination with the restricted Tasmanian distribution and dispersal capabilities of the species, suggests that G. gymnota was introduced to Tasmania from New Zealand.|48 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
