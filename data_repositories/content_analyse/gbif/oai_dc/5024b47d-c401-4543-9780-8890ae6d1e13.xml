Volunteer bird watchers select their own area and every winter they count twice, in December and in late January / early February. Also the absence of Great Grey Shrikes was noted (0 counts). The results of these yearly counts are captured in maps that show the presence / absence of these birds (http://waarneming.nl/tel_project_new/gmap/262). For this dataset, covering the winter of 2013/ 2014, in total 197 individual birds were monitored in 167 areas. The dataset contains multiple counts per individual.|1,458 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
