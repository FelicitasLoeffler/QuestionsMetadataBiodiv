The 1995 survey was the first national survey, however other regional surveys and estimates suggested that the British population was in decline. The 2007 survey was designed to explore whether the species had continued to decline.  The 1995 survey was carried out by the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (IWC) with financial support from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT). The 2007 survey was carried out by the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). These surveys were both carried out under the Statutory Conservation Agencies and RSPB Breeding Birds Scheme (SCARABBS) partnership, with support from the SCARABBS partner organisations.|257 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
