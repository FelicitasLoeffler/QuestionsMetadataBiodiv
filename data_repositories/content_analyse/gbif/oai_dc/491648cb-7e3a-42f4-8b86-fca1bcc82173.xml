The dataset covers robberflies, bee flies, soldierflies, horseflies and their allies. Data were collected by volunteer recorders and compiled by the Larger Brachycera Recording Scheme, which began in 1976.|Records are collated in order to add to knowledge of this group, including distribution, population trends, autecology and phenology. In addition, the scheme works with all contributing recorders to raise the profile of the species group and its conservation. Sharing the data via NBN helps achieve these aims.|20,891 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
