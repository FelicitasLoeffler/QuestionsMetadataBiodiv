In Scotland it occurs among damp grasslands and heaths that are usually associated with some form of grazing. A survey was undertaken in autumns 2014 and 2015 of designated sites supporting E. aurinia.|The purpose of Site Condition Monitoring is to determine the condition of the designated natural feature within a site. This is to establish whether the natural feature is likely to maintain itself in the medium to longer term under the current management regime and wider environmental or other influences. An effort was made to assess additional 1 km squares within designated sites where suitable habitat was thought to be present confirm further areas for habitat management if required.|86 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
