Therefore to manage aquatic vascular plants more effectively and support academic and industrial applications, we have planed to construct a aquatic vascular plants database system with the informations about identification, classification, reference, residence/distribution, image, economical value, and genetic character. Firstly, we constructed a schema using Crow's Foot ERD (Entity-relationship diagram) and then developed the standard interface for sharing with other biological databases. This kind of Database will make it possible to efficiently integrate, store and retrieve information data on the web about native aquatic vascular plants in Korea.|70 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
