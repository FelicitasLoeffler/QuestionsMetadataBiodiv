The economic importance of these species have been documented in several published and unpublished papers in Malawi. Although these species are not documented in the Malawian Red Data List, their wide use in the commercial companies in Malawi warrant their evaluation. The current list consists of only 4 species among many which require to be evaluated as they may be under great threat.These specimens were collected by different botanists throughout the country on general collection trips and deposited at the National Herbarium and Botanical Gardens of Malawi. Please note that the present dataset does not represent the entire geographical range of the species because some have no coordinates. In recent years, NHBG has done more taxon sampling but these haven&#8217;t been digitized fully as the digitization process only began in 2017. The number of collections can be estimated at above 3000.|The dataset ids part of the African Biodiversity Challenge project whose aim is to mobise data for scientific work. Furthermore, the dataset will help with evaluation of these species using IUCN red list categories in Malawi which is currently an ongoing process.|70 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
