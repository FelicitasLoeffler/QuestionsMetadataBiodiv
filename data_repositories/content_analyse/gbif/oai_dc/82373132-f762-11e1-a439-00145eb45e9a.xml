Three benthic foraminifer zones are distinguished within Unit II. The upper part of the unit is dominated by Spirillina polygyrata, contains Globospirillina spp. (Samples 149-901A-3R-1, 10-12 cm, to 149-901A-3R-1, 75-77 cm) and is interpreted as late Tithonian. Samples 149-901A-3R-1, 87-89 cm, to 149-901A-6R-1, 74-76 cm, contain Epistomina uhligi and Lingulina franconica and are probably early Tithonian. The early Tithonian Neobulimina atlantica Zone is characterized by the occurrence of the zonal marker and Epistomina uhligi and reaches from Sample 149-901A-6R-1, 128-130 cm, to the base of the drilled-sequence. The sediments and benthic foraminiferal assemblage characteristics of the Tithonian-aged sequence in Hole 901A are unknown elsewhere in the Atlantic and may represent deposition in a marginal shelf basin with increased terrigenous and organic flux.|235 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
