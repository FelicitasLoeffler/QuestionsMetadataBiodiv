Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoo sightings are recorded to within 10m by GPS, the number of individuals, sex and age (where possible), travel direction and altitude, and feeding behaviour are noted.The data are mostly (but not all) from the Ginninderra Creek corridor, Belconnen, ACT where they are included in a study of YTBC habitat use (study is provisionally &amp;#34,Restoration of Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoo habitat in an urbanised landscape&amp;#34,). Most of them fall within my 200m - wide belt transects which are downstream from Lake Ginninderra but others are from different stretches upstream and elsewhere in the Ginninderra Creek catchment.  Each of the 6 sections are surveyed opportunistically - sometimes singly, sometimes collectively.|170 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
