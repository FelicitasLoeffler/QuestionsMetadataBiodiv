Component 5 of the CPACC project, Coral Reef Monitoring for Climate Change Impacts, was designed to establish a long term monitoring programme in the region. Under CPACC, the University of the West Indies - Centre for Marine Sciences provided technical assistance in the execution of the coral reef monitoring programme in three pilot countries (The Bahamas, Belize and Jamaica). Jamaica continued monitoring beyond the pilot year (2000) and these datasets represent the results of the coral reef monitoring conducted in Jamaica for the period 2000-2003.|194 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
