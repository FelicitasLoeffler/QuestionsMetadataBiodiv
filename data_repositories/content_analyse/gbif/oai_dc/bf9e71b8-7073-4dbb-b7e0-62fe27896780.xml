The Hills are located opposite Malosa Mountain Forest reserve alon the road to Liwonde, Machinga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot sampling was done along a defined transect on the hills using 10X10 plot size with a distance of 50m between plots. A 10X10m plot was chosen because of the difficult terrain in these mountains. The standard plot size is usually 50X50m. For each plot, the coordinates, altitude and the plant species present were recorded.&lt;/p&gt;|This data was collected as part of the day to day work for National Herbarium and Botanic Gardens of Malawi. There were a series of field trips to this area in 2005 and some are still existing as raw data. This data will be made available later as this process of publishing will be incorporated in our day to day activities.|191 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
