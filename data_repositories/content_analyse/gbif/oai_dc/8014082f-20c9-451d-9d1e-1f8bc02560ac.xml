Measurements of carbonate contents, organic carbon and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes were also reported. These data allow a correlation to be made of the Baddeckenstedt section with those at Misburg (basinal facies, northwestern Germany) and Dover (Plenus Marls, southern England). Significant maxima of the organic carbon content at Baddeckenstedt correspond to prominent black shale couplets at Misburg. The planktonic foraminiferal generic groups show at Baddeckenstedt similar fluctuations as reported from Dover. Their correlation reveals details of a complex paleoceanographic regime in the NW-German Basin during the Cenomanian/Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event.|27 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
