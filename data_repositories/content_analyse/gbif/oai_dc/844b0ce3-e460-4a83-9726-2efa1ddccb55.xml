The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;-The present project integrates the soil animal community, predominantly nematodes, as an integral and essential part of terrestrial ecosystems. Its functioning is critical for element cycling and thereby feeds back to plants and the aboveground system.|18 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
