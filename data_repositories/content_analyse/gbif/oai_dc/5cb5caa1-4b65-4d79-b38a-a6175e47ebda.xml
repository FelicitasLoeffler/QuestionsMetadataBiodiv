This tool helps expert bat researchers and bat research assessors determine what from a legal standpoint a reasonable amount of effort is to spend on a specific location.The protocol combines existing knowledge about prime field conditions, survey periods and the number and length of field visits. The protocol does not indicate the conditions in which bats are likely to occur, but the conditions in which the bats are most likely to be observed.The protocol has been developed to conduct effective research for the Nature Conservation Act. If the protocol is followed, this generally ensures that from a legal perspective a responsible effort has been made to check if species or functions of areas have been disrupted. Especially when the presence of an area&#8217;s function or species needs to be excluded, research projects that follow the protocol should be satisfactory from a legal standpoint.Applying the protocol guarantees 2 things:The Rural Areas Department will not require additional inventory research with a (pro forma) dispensation request of the Nature Conservation ActThe research will hold up during a legal procedure.Dataset available via https://www.ndff.nl/english / serviceteamndff@natuurloket.nlPositive observations without zeros.https://www.ndff.nl/overdendff/validatie/protocollen/17-505-vleermuisprotocol-2017/</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
