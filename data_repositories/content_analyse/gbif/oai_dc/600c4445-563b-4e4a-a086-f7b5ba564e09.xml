This dataset contains all records of beetles identified from pitfall trapping conducted across the 62 Machair LIFE+ biodiversity monitoring plots. For some records an aggregate of 2 species was recorded which is not available through the NHM species dictionary. In these cases the record is given here as the genus, with the species aggregate recorded in the comments.  Precise dates for the records are not known, and thus the year of the observations is given here. The grid references for each record relate to the central point of the recording plot. As the plots were generally quite small (c.150m by 50m) these are reasonably geographically accurate.|9,517 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
