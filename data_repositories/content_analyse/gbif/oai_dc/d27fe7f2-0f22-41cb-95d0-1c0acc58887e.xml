ACSSI not only maintains an important resource of microalgal and cyanobacterial biodiversity but affords all its strains for studying by scientific community for fundamental science and for solution of applied biotechnology problems and educational purposes. Initiator and Director of the &#1057;ollection is Dr. Anna D. Temraleeva. The curator of the &#1057;ollection is Svetlana V. Moskalenko. ACSSI Collection is registered in World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) under the number 1132 (http://www.wfcc.info/ccinfo/index.php/collection/by_id/1132).The database &#8220;Cyanobacteria of Algal Collection of Soil Science Institute (ACSSI)&#8221; includes a list and information on the findings of cyanobacteria in different soil types on the territory of Russia. Here we published only species list of the database, but more complete information about algae species is available from the website http://acssi.org.The reported study was supported by RFBR, research project No. 16-34-60020 mol_a_dk.|37 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
