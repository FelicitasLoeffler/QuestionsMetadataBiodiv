A faunal checklist published in 1995 (https://www.uvm.edu/femc/attachments/project/999/reports/VTmothsbutterflies.pdf) listed 28 species for Vermont. This dataset adds 9 more species to the faunal list for Vermont. Part of this dataset was contributed to https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185683. This study demonstrated that at least ten of the 26 species examined, or more than one-third, were found to be in long-term decline or locally extirpated, whereas four species increased from 1900&#8211;2012 in the northeastern U.S.|1,649 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
