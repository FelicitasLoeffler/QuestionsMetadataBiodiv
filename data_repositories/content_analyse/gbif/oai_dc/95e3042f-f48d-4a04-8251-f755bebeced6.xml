Additionally some important demographic variables were monitored to further explain these changes (i.e. arthropod abundance). Research activities also included research on breeding ecology of Brent Geese in relation to Snowy Owls.|The aim of this study was to focus in a standardized way on numbers (number of territories or number of nests) of all bird species present within fixed plots, in order to reveal temporal changes in breeding bird numbers at Medusa Bay, Additionally, some important demographic variables were monitored to explain changes in breeding bird numbers and breeding success. Research activities also included research on breeding ecology of Brent Geese in relation to Snowy Owls.|653 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
