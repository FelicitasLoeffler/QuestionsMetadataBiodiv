<data><id>139a966c-22d5-486b-bff2-cfcbccd6fdfc</id><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This dataset includes the survey data that were collected during the Marine Nature Conservation Review (MNCR) between 1987 and 1998, together with data from surveys commissioned by the Nature Conservancy Council in the 1970s and 1980s and data collected subsequently by JNCC. The MNCR was initiated to provide a comprehensive baseline of information on marine habitats and their associated species around the coast of Britain which would aid coastal zone and sea-use management and to contribute to the identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance. The focus of MNCR work was on benthic habitats (often referred to as 'biotopes') in intertidal and inshore (typically within 3nm) subtidal areas.|The main purpose of the MNCR programme was to advance the basic knowledge of the near shore benthos. This included:  - identifying sites and species of nature conservation importance.   - extend our knowledge of benthic marine habitats, communities and species in Great Britain, particularly through description of their characteristics, distribution and extent.   - provide information through the data collected to support more general measures required to minimize adverse effects of development.|579,543 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
