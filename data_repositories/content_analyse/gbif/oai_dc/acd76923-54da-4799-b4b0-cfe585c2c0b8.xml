Our goal was to describe the quantitative and qualitative structure and spatial variation of the community of macromycetes, show its dynamics seasonally and inter-annually and also elucidate the relationship between the fruiting and climate variables. A total of 263 circular 5 m^2 (for a total area of 1315 m^2) plots were visited weekly during vegetation seasons 2014-2018 and carpophores of different fungal taxa were counted. The dataset includes about 16000 plot-based observations (=sampling events) made from 2014 until 2018 with corresponding about 6000 occurrence records of macromycetes identified to species. Plot-based observations with zero records mark absence of species in a certain plot and time.|6,145 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
