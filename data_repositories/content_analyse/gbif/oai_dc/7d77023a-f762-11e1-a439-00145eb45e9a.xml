The present study describes reconstructions of deepwater conditions during this time interval based on benthic foraminiferal assemblages from sediment core M23414 (Rockall Plateau, North Atlantic). The results of faunal analysis were supported by planktic d18O, sea surface temperature reconstructions based on planktic foraminiferal assemblages and content of ice rafted debris. Statistical data processing using principal component analysis revealed five climaterelated benthic foraminiferal associations that changed in response to alterations of deepwater circulation.|789 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
