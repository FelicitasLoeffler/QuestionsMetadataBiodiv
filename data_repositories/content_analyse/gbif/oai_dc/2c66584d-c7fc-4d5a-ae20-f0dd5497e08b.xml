They are supplied by the 12-year Species 2000 NZ project coordinated by Dennis Gordon at NIWA, and published as the New Zealand Inventory of Biodiversity (NZIB). NZIB provides baseline data as a component of the recently established New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR), led by Jerry Cooper.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
