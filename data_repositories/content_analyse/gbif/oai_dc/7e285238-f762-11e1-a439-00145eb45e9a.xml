Special collections of 5.000 each are the herbarium of Herbert Frankenh&#228;user from Rwanda (c. 5000 specimens), the Herbarium of Albert Oesau from Rhineland-Palatinate(c. 5000 specimens), and the collection of mosses and liverworts from Ruprecht D&#252;ll (c. 10.000 specimens). Meinhard Grubert gathered Podostemaceae (preserved in alcohol) from waterfalls in Venezuela. A worldwide seed and fruit collection with 16.500 specimens came from Ulrich Hecker. In 2009 the remaining parts of the Herbarium of the University of Cologne (KOELN) were transfered to Mainz. This herbarium contains vouchers from the Rhineland which were collected at the beginning of the 20th century by Paul Thyssen, Ludwig Laven and August Schlickum. Another important historical collection is (the part of) the Herbarium Ludwig Geisenheyner which came to Mainz in 1990. This collection contains approx. 3.500 specimens of Pteridophyta, Poaceae and Caryophyllaceae.|1,001 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
