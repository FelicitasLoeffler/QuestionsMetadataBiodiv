The specimens were collected in the PhD project of Alberdi (2003), which assessed the recovery of vascular plants 6-7 years after a fire event occurred in 1994 in a mixed Quercus ilex subsp. ballota- Q. faginea forest. The forest is located in the south slope of sierra Costalera, in the boundary between the Mediterranean and Eurosiberian biogeographical regions (Nazar, Navarra, northern Spain). Four area types were surveyed in the study: non-disturbed forest, cleared forest, burned forest and burned grassland. The most relevant families were Compositae, Gramineae, Leguminosae and Labiatae. Disturbed areas were more species rich than non-disturbed ones. Leguminosae, Gramineae and Compositae were also more frequent in disturbed areas.|1,211 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
