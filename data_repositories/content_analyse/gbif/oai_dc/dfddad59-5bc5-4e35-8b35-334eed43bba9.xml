The aim was to use freshwater macroinvertebrates to calculate the biological indices required to evaluate the ecological status of the open water bodies within this basin. This dataset is a part of a monitoring network set up by the Confederaci&#243;n Hidrogr&#225;fica del Ebro (hereinafter CHE). This network was established to fulfill the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive (hereinafter WFD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection is composed of 1776 sampling events carried out between 2005 and 2015 at more than 400 sampling sites. Environmental variables at each sampling site were also recorded to characterise the habitat, and  can be found in the MeasurementOrFacts extension (eMoF) uploaded along with the sampling event dataset. All measurements were obtained from the CHE portal (CHE, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Museum of Zoology of the University of Navarra (hereinafter MZNA) curates the material obtained during these samplings. Samples were qualitatively screened for all occurring taxa, and all individuals from all taxa in a quantitative subsample of each sample were counted. Biological indices were calculated to estimate water quality at each sampling site. An occurrence extension is also available gathering the abundance of each taxon within the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;|The aim of the present dataset is to provide all information from the CEMAS project conducted in the Ebro River Basin from 2005 to 2015.|266,400 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
