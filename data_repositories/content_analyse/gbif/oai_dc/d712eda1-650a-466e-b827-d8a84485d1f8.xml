The database has been compiled primarily as a tool for taxonomic revisions and to produce checklists and monographs. Recent outputs have been A Handbook of the World&amp;#039,s Conifers (2010) and An Atlas of the World&amp;#039,s Conifers (2013), both by A. Farjon and published by Brill in Leiden. Work on the database is in progress. Over 4,000 new conifer common names in 20 languages and additional references have been contributed as a result of 4D4Life pilot projects.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
