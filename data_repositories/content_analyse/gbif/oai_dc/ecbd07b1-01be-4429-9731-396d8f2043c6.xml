Nitrate-storing microorganisms were identified by amplicon sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) of Eukaryotes and diatoms (18S rRNA gene). The organisms that were identified by sequencing were evaluated in regard to their ability and capacity to store intracellular nitrate.|5,147 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
