Records date back to 1897. The majority of data came from published manuscripts and additional digital records from Smithsonian Antarctic Invertebrates (http://invertebrates.si.edu/antiz/) and for South Africa, Natural Geography in Shore Areas (NaGISA) from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Rigby et al., 2005). A record was considered to be intertidal if it was found between the high tide mark down to a maximum of 3m depth (allowing for variable tidal range in Antarctica).|3,902 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
