It is renowned for its safari landscapes, stunning rainforests and Mt. Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in the world. The country's vast wildness, rainforests, rivers and lakes make it a natural home for many different species of native and endemic amphibian species, many of which are in danger.There are many efforts that are being done to help the native amphibians of Tanzania, many of which are endangered species. As can be seen in the case of the Kihansi Spray Toad there are efforts underway nationally and internationally to have breeding programs in place to help bring up the population and try to save species that are endangered.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
