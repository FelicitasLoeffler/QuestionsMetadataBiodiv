Methylamine is a volatile organic compound generated by degradation of organic matter. The biodegradation of methylamine by marine microorganisms is a major factor modulating the emission of this compound into the atmosphere, where methylamine influences global climate processes. As methylamine contains carbon as well as nitrogen, it can serve as a source of both elements for microorganisms So far, little is known about the identity of the active methylamine oxidisers in marine habitats, especially regarding organisms that use methylamine as a nitrogen source. In this study, Stable Isotope Probing using 15N labelled methylamine was combined with 16S rRNA and functional gene amplicon sequencing as well as metagenome sequencing to identify bacteria that are involved in methylamine degradation or assimilation of methylamine derived nitrogen in samples obtained from the Western Channel Observatory station L4.|3,739 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
