It includes the vast majority of species cited for Portugal, from all regions in the country. However, there is some predominance of samples from Natural Parks, in particular from Serra da Estrela and Peneda-Ger&#234;s. The main collectors are F. Welwitsch, A.X Pereira Coutinho, C.N. Tavares, C. S&#233;rgio, M. Sim-Sim and C. Garcia. The time frame includes records from 1840 to the present, although about 75% of specimens were collected after 1980. The total number of bryophyte specimens existing in the herbarium is about 70 000, and includes Madeira and Azores regions, and specimens from foreign countries. The digitising process is ongoing, which will result in new additions to this resource in the near future.|21,792 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
