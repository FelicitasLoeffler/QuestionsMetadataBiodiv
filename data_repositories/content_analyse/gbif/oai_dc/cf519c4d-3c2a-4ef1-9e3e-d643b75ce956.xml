The dataset includes records of wild boar/feral pig and other wild mammals recorded by camera-traps.|The survey was undertaken to find out how feral pigs are using four different habitat types (Native woodland, Plantation woodland, Young woodland, Open habitats) within the Glen Garry study area. The data collected can also be used to estimate pig density within the woodland, although estimates of population density are restricted in accuracy by the limited number of camera traps used and the lack of information on range covered by individual animals.|163 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
