These include Canaceoides angulatus from Kahoolawae and Procanace bifurcata from Molokai and Maui, and Procanace constricta from Oahu. A new species from Kauai, Procanace hardyi O'Grady and Pak, is described. This species is closely related to P. constricta from Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Hawaii and shares a similar constriction of the abdomen between tergites four and five but differs in the configuration of the seventh abdominal tergite. Detailed distribution maps for all species are included.|794 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
