The data were collected as part of a wider survey of pinewood birds (Scottish Crossbill and Capercaillie). Surveys were conducted over 3 winters, 92/93, 93/94 and 94/95, by walking transects in areas of suitable habitat (native pine forest and plantation woodland) near and within the known distribution of Crested tits. The results were used to derive a population estimate for Scotland of between 5600 and 7900 birds.  This dataset contains the raw data. Details explaining how populations were derived can be found in the published paper (Summer et al 1999). Crested tits showed a clear preference for Scots Pine both within ancient native pinewoods and other woodlands. The results of this survey suggest that Crested Tits will continue to benefit from planting of Scots pines if the woods develop a heather field layer.  However, they will not benefit from spruce plantations.|107 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
