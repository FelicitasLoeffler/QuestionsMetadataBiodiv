We manage threatened species conservation and recovery, biodiversity research, invasive species, and climate change adaptation strategies. - See more at: http://www.delwp.vic.gov.au/environment-and-wildlife#sthash.giDedj4S.dpufThe Victorian Biodiversity Atlas (VBA) is the web-based information system designed to manage information about native and naturalised species occurring in Victoria. The system includes species attribute information, including origin and conservation status, along with more than six million records of species distribution and abundance. All the published records have been through the verification process of the VBA which includes review by a panel of Victorian experts. The VBA includes the data submitted to DELWP from external sources as well as the Department&#8217;s own data collections from systematic surveys and general observations. The VBA replaces several legacy systems, including the Victorian Flora Site Database, the Atlas of Victorian Wildlife, the Aquatic Fauna Database and the Victorian Rare or Threatened Plant Population monitoring (VROTPop) systems. For further information and access to the VBA please go to the DELWP website http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/environment-and-wildlife/biodiversity/victorian-biodiversity-atlas).|6,905,471 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
