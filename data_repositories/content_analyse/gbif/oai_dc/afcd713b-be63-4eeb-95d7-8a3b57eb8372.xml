The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;Specialisation of flower visitors is compared across grasslands along a gradient of land use intensity. We focus on resource-based mechanisms that may determine flower visiting insect communities in different habitats. We analyze flower diversity and abundance as well as pollinator diversity and abundance and flower visiting rates of pollinators in order to measure possible variation between differently used sites. Moreover, we will characterize the degree of specialisation on species and community level (pollinator networks, Bl&#252;thgen et al. 2007).|1,769 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
