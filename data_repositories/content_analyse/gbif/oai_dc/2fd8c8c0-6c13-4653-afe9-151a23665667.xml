The data were mostly collected between January and April in the years 1995-2005 when Crossbills can reasonably be assumed to be in a territory or breeding, however since the birds were only identified by calls breeding status can not be confirmed.  The Scottish Crossbill was once thought to be a subspecies of either the Common Crossbill or the Parrot Crossbill but is now thought to be Britain's only endemic bird species.  A full survey was also carried out in 2008.  This survey was funded by the RSPB.|850 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
