Aim of the project was to summarize and digitalize the data of the dried and otherwise preserved specimens stored in the German herbaria as well as of the living strains, cultured in culture collections. Many of the references are completed by figures of the labels or by scanned micrographs from preparations for the light- or scanning microscopes.|603 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
