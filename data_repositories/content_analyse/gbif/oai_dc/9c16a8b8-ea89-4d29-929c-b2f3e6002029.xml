Although no new records are now registered the taxonomy has been updated. New information regarding the specific occurrence of the rare Odontaspis ferox was recently published (see Barcelos et al. 2018). As for the updated checklist of Azores' Actinopterygii, the first comprehensive chondrichthyan checklist was published by Santos et al. (1997) and later updated by Porteiro et al.
