Monitoring data is essential to assess the population health and distribution of rare and threatened species, as well as integral to the decision making about management techniques etc. that should be carried out for species and at specific sites. It gives a clear indication of population trends and informs our UK conservation fieldwork.|218 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
