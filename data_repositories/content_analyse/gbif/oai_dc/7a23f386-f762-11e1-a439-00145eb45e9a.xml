At present, it contains the information of 16.635 individuals of the 143 Iberian Aphodiidae species. A database-record was defined as a pool of specimens of a single species with identical database field values (locality, UTM coordinates, altitude, date of capture (day/month/year), type of habitat and food resource, among others) regardless of the number of specimens, so any difference in any database field value gave rise to a new database-record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: this dataset was previously orphaned. It has been rescued by &#9312; extracting it from the GBIF.org index (see GBIF Download in External Data) and &#9313; republishing it on this IPT data hosting centre as version 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;|16,632 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
