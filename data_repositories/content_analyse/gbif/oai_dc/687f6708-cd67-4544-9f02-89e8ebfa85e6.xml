The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;Flower availability is estimated by determining the number of 'flower units' across the grassland types of the Exploratories as a basis for analyzing flower-visitor interactions networks. We focus on resource-based mechanisms that may determine flower visiting insect communities in different habitats.|988 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
