The purpose of these specimens is: 1) to serve as voucher documentation for research projects, 2) to serve as resources for plant identification, and 3) to serve as exemplars in plant courses. In addition, the herbarium both receives and provides loans of plant specimens used in active systematic research. The herbarium collection specializes in land plant specimens from San Diego County, California, and Baja California, with some collections from Australia, Chile, and the south Pacific.|22,343 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
