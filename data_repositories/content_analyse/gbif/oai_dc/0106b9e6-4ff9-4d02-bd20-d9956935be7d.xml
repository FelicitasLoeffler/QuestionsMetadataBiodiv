Cockroaches belong to the order Blattodea (sometimes known as Blattaria) as too do the termites. In the past termites were thought to be a separate order, Isoptera, but recent work confirms that they are in fact blattodeans. The CSF includes c. 6,700 scientific names (all ranks, valid and not valid) and c. 4,600 valid species are recognised. Images of museum specimens (especially types), plus pictures of living cockroaches are slowly being added.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
