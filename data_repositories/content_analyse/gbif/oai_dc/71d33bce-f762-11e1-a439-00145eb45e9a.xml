The sizes and locations of all 57 colonies are given as a baseline for future changes in the species abundance. Current estimates of the sizes of two colonies are compared with historical estimates made by the Australian Antarctic Expedition in 1912-13. Note that the total estimate is included in the Inventory of Antarctic Seabirds dataset as a single record.|57 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
