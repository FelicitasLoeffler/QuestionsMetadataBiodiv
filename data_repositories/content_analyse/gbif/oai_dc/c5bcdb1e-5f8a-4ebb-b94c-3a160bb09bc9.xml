Lithology and microfaunal assemblages allow the division of these deposits into two parts. The lower part extends from the lower Barremian to the basal upper Barremian and possibly down into the upper Hauterivian. Three foraminiferal associations suggest an orderly evolution from a low-energy, littoral environment, in which continental influences dominated, to progressively more open marine conditions. A dolosparite bed (which has not yet been dated) separates these synrift deposits from lower to basal middle Albian postrift sediments that developed in a pelagic bathyal environment on the middle to nearby lower continental slope.|1,851 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
