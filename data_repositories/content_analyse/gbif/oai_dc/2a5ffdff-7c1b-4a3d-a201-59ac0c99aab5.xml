These key baseline data will support future studies on elasmobranchs inother areas of the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve and fill in gaps on the status ofelasmobranch populations in the region. This will be combined with large existingBRUV and eDNA datasets collected in other key locations around the world for a globalanalysis.|Objective 1: Complete a survey of reef elasmobranch (sharks and batoids)relative abundance and diversity in coral reef ecosystems along Isla CayosdeAlbuquerque (San Andr&#233;s Archipelago) using BRUVs, eDNA and drumlines.Objective 2: Include Colombia&#8217;s Caribbean reefs into global projects, whoseoverarching goal is to consolidate existing and newly collected BRUV andeDNA data into a single analysis, producing the first globally standard surveyof elasmobranch density and diversity over the world&#8217;s continental and insularshelves, focusing on coral reef ecosystems, using these methodologies.Objective 3: Frame the results in such a way to identify contemporary hotspotsof reef elasmobranch abundance and diversity and highlight the differencesbetween pristine and impacted sites for all habitat types.|106 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
