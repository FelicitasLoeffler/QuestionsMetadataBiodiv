Records originate from a variety of sources, with the collation held and maintained by People's Trust for Endangered Species (PTES). It is an incomplete directory of sites due to the ad-hoc nature of data collection. Some sites are regularly monitored using nestboxes as part of the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP), these sites are indicated in the attributes and more detailed biometric data are held by PTES who administer the monitoring programme.  The original database held by PTES includes the record source but this is not included in the Gateway version.|The dataset was originally compiled to hold data arising from the Great Nut Hunts and to build a complete and up to date picture of the distribution of the dormouse in the UK. This has been used for reporting on the delivery of the Biodiversity Action Plan.|26,731 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
