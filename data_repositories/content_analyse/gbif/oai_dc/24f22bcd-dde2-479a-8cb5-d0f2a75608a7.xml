The data is stored together with descriptive metadata, in combination called a dataset, in the project repository (https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de). Species information was extracted from that original dataset. The second paragraph is part of the metadata of the original dataset.&lt;/br&gt;In this data file 16S rRNA gene based analysis of forest and grassland soil procaryotic community composition "Schwaebische Alb" is stored.|265 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
