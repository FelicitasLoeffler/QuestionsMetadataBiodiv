The data in this dataset is part of the vegetation-plot data used to feed the model and contains groundwater depending terrestrial vegetation relev&#233;es in relation to groundwater levels. Vegetation plot relev&#233;s were performed near selected piezometers (WATINA database, groundwater network Flanders) between May and August in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Initially the vegetation surveys were recorded in Turboveg (Hennekens, 1998) and later on moved to INBOVEG, the INBO vegetation plot database. The dataset contains 569 vegetation relev&#233;es, recorded during the fieldwork of the NICHE-Vlaanderen project. Relev&#233;es contain species coverage data, coverage data for layers, vegetation height and the date of recording. All the vegetation relev&#233;es were classified as vegetation types.

The "NICHE-Vlaanderen" tool will be used to predict the effects on vegetation due to changes in hydrological conditions. This dataset only contains the vegetation plot data collected during the time of the project (2002 &#8211; 2006). The complete NICHE-Vlaanderen set also contains data of literature.|8,593 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
