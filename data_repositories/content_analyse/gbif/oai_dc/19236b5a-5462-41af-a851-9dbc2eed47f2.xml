Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal RNA genes indicated a placement within Dinemasporium and confirmed that the species is distinct from the morphologically hardly distinguishable D. cruciferum, therefore, the new combination D. spinificis is proposed.|7 occurrences</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><date
