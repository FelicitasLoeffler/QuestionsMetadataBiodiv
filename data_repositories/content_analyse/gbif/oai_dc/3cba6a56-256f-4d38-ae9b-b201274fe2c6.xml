Nematodes are the most commonly encountered and abundant metazoans of Victoria Land soils, yet little is known of their diversity and distribution. Herein we present a summary of the geographic distribution, habitats and ecology of the terrestrial nematodes of Victoria Land from published and unpublished sources.Published in Zookeys as: Ecological Biogeography of the Terrestrial Nematodes of Victoria Land, Antarctica.
