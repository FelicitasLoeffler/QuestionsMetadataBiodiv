Each row corresponds to an individual bird, and each column corresponds to a unique amino acid sequence at MHC II&#223; (&#8220;allele&#8221;). Presence or absence of each allele in each individual&#8217;s genotype is denoted by 1 or 0, respectively. Alleles are listed here as X1, X2, &#8230; and correspond to sequences SOSP-DAB*1, SOSP-DAB*2, &#8230; on Figure S1 and on GenBank.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>birdsong|compatible genes|genetic diversity|major histocompatibility complex|song sparrow</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
