Consumer groups are the ten selected taxonomic groups (ants, blattodea, chilopoda, coleoptera, diplopoda, isopoda, isoptera, opiliones, orthoptera, spiders), three functional feeding guilds (detritivores, predators, omnivores) and the complete consumer community (all). Predictor variables are litter mass (LM), plant species richness (prich), soil pH (pH), and litter carbon to element ratios for N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and S. Coef gives the standardized coefficient of each predictor for each averaged model. Confint_lower_boundary and confint_upper_boundary give the 95% confidence interval for the coefficients. It should be noted that for all stoichiometric parameters, negative coefficients indicate a positive effect of the respective elemental availability as the models were run on C:element ratios. As such, a positive effect of e.g. C:N corresponds to a negative effect of N in main text Fig. 1.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ecological stoichiometry|consumer-resource interaction|elemental ratios|model averaging|consumer species richness|consumer biomass</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
