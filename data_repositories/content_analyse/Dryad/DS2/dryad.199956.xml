However, epidemiological surveys of MERS in Korea indicated that some secondary patients were infected without close contact. Therefore, the possibility of other transmission routes must be identified. In this study, the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow was investigated on the 8th floor of Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital. Computational fluid dynamics was used to analyze the indoor airflow and passive tracer diffusion during the index patient&#8217;s stay. Six cases were simulated for different outdoor wind directions and indoor mechanical ventilation operations. When a passive tracer was released in ward 8104, where the index patient was hospitalized, the passive tracer spread through the indoor airflow, which was created by the outdoor airflow. Ward 8109, which had the largest number of infected cases and was far distant from ward 8104, showed passive tracer concentration in all cases. This result indicates that MERS may have spread through airflow. The study results do not imply that the infection pathway of MERS is airborne. However, the results show the possibility of MERS spreading through airflow in specific environments such as poor ventilation environments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Middle East Respiratory Syndrome|Hospital infection|Airflow analysis|Transmission route|Computational fluid dynamics|Ventilation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
