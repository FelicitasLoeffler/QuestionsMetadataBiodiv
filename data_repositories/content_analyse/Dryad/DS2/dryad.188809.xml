These are provided as TIF files. All imaging parameters are included in the image metadata. They are labeled as follows: A7PS309_s9_t1 = WT LSI, Dilution factor = 1A7PS309_s10_t1 = WT LSI, Dilution factor = 1/2A7PS309_s11_t1 = WT LSI, Dilution factor = 1/4A7PS309_s12_t1 = WT LSI, Dilution factor = 1/8A7PS309_s25_t1 = Rag1KO LSI, Dilution factor = 1A7PS309_s26_t1 = Rag1KO LSI, Dilution factor = 1/2A7PS309_s27_t1 = Rag1KO LSI, Dilution factor = 1/4A7PS309_s28_t1 = Rag1KO LSI, Dilution factor = 1/8A7PS284_s13_t1 = HBSSAdditionally, this file contains .csv files of all the statistics on particle sizes collected by the ImageJ macro. These are labeled in the format &#8220;zstackname_automated_counting_statistics&#8221;, where &#8220;zstackname&#8221; is the title of the associated z-stack. It also contains a .csv file of the particle # IDs of the singlet particles that were used to get the average singlet size, which was then used to normalize the ECDFs (as explained in detail in Materials and Methods). These are labeled in the format &#8220;zstackname_singlet_IDs&#8221;, where &#8220;zstackname&#8221; is the title of the associated z-stack. These .csv files were used in combination with the Jupyter notebooks (provided with this submission) to generate Figure 6, panels B and D.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>dietary fiber|small intestine|depletion interactions|flocculation|colloids|drug delivery</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
