The formations are famous for their rich fossil faunas. Although bryozoans are absent in late Aptian sediments, they are frequently found encrusting bivalve shells from the early to middle Albian parts of these formations. Here, we describe the cyclostome bryozoan fauna, which includes six species, Stomatopora sp., Oncousoecia khirar n. sp., Reptomultisparsa helenae n. sp., Hyporosopora keera n. sp., Mesonopora bernardwalteri n. sp. and ?Unicavea sp. Most cyclostomes are found encrusting rudist shells from Unit 2 of the Lower Member of the Glen Rose Formation and units 3 and 6 of the Upper Member of the Glen Rose Formation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Taxonomy</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
