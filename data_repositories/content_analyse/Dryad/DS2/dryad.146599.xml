Individual represents the identity of the marten encountered, trap represents the trap number at which the individual was encountered, check corresponds to the check # during which the individual marten was detected at the specific detection station, and detection type corresponds to the type of detection: 2 represents detection by camera only, 3 represents detection by non-invasive genetic sampling only, and 4 represents detection by both camera and non-invasive genetic sampling.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>occupancy|distribution|density|American marten</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
