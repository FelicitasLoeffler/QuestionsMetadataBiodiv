Biomass estimates are based on amounts of ergosterol (a fungal-specific biomass marker), quantified using liquid chromatography. Growth estimates are derived from  biomass estimates and mathematical models.  Estimates of carbon use efficiency are based on growth and respiration estimates. Gross primary production estimates are based on eddy covariance flux measurements.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>boreal|carbon use efficiency|chronosequence|ectomycorrhiza|extraradical mycelium|mycelial biomass|mycelial respiration|soil respiration</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
