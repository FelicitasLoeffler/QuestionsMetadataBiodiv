The diffusion coefficients are calculated using the theory of Ferrari and Nikurashin (2010). The dataset includes the suppressed and unsupressed diffusivities, as well as the supression factor (the ratio of the unsuppressed and suppressed diffusivity)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Physical Oceanography</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
