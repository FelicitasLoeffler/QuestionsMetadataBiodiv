Each row corresponds to a different inhaler inhalation recording. Column 1 contains the anonymized participant numbers, Column 2 contains the inspiratory flow range group to which each recording belongs to. Details of this labeling is given in the manuscript. Column 3 contains the inhalation flow signals and Column 4 contains the acoustic envelope signals from the inhalation audio recordings. Signals are low pass filtered below 4Hz. Moving average filter not applied to acoustic envelope signals until after flow estimation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
