These metric files were generated using the freely available Caret software developed in the Van Essen Laboratory at the Washington University School of Medicine in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA, available at &lt;http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Caret:About&gt;. The metric files can be opened with this program and overlaid on the monkey F99 cortical model of the right hemisphere. Enhanced activation is show as negative values (i.e in blue), due to the use of contrast agent for functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>fMRI|social cognition|macaque</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
