The first column describes the population from which each individual originated, either the wild population located at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar, or the captive population, including animals from the Cincinnati Zoo, the Indianapolis Zoo, and the Duke Lemur Center. The second column gives the name of each individual lemur. The third column lists each allele possessed by the individual listed in the second column, such that an individual with 4 MHC-DRB alleles will be listed in 4 rows, each row containing a different allele in the third column. Lastly, the fourth column contains the total number of MHC-DRB alleles possessed by that individual.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>MHC-DRB|genetic diversity|inbreeding|strepsirrhine primate|immunogenetics|conservation genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
