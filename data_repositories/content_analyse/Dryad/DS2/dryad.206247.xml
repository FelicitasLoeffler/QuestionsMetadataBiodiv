The .html and .ipynb files are identical. The code was written with Python version 3.6.4. It has been verified to work with numpy version 1.13.3, pandas version 0.21.1, scipy version 1.0.0, bokeh version 0.12.15, holoviews version 1.9.1, and numba version 0.36.2.  The test data folder provides data that can be used to verify that the code is working. Make sure to change the file paths to what is appropriate for your computer. The test data will reproduce Figure 7G from the main text. This data was also provided as part of &#8220;Figure 7 &#8211; source data 4&#8221;.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>dietary fiber|small intestine|depletion interactions|flocculation|colloids|drug delivery</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
