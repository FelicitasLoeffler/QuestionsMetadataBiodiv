This species is featured with hemispheric to plane dark brown to brownish orange pileus, concolorous or darker stipe, snow white to pale yellow pore surface which is immutable when bruised, 2- to 4-spored basidia, reniform to elliptic basidiospores, presence of pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia, absence of caulocystidia, trichoderm pattern of pileipellis and stipitipellis with encrusted erect hyphal elements and occurrence under Castanopsis sp. Macro- and micromorphological details coupled with phylogenetic analyses (based on nrITS and nrLSU data) are presented for this taxon.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Basidiomycota|morpho-taxonomy|phylogeny</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
