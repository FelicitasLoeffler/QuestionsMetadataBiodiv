The observed crack distribution was fitted to the normal, lognormal and weibull probability distribution function. The function that gave the best fit was used to calculate the mean crack spacing of the coatings.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>medical implant|chromium oxide coating|Ringers solution|corrosion|adhesion strength</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
