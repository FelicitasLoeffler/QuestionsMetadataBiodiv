We assessed the potential of Porites astreoides, Siderastrea siderea and Porites porites to survive and calcify under acidified conditions in a two-year field transplant experiment around low-pH, low aragonite saturation (&#937;arag) submarine springs. Slow-growing S. siderea had the highest post-transplantation survival and showed an increase in tissue concentrations of Symbiodiniaceae, chlorophyll a, and protein at the low &#937;arag site. Nubbins of P. astreoides had 20% lower survival and higher chlorophyll a concentration at the low &#937;arag site. Only 33% of P. porites nubbins survived at low &#937;arag and their linear extension and calcification rates were reduced. The density of skeletons deposited after transplantation was 15-30% lower for all species at the low &#937;arag spring. These results suggest that corals with slow calcification rates and high Symbiodiniaceae, chlorophyll a and protein concentrations may be less susceptible to ocean acidification, albeit with reduced skeletal density. We postulate that corals in the springs are responding to greater energy demands for overcoming larger differences in carbonate chemistry between the calcifying medium and the external environment. The differential mortality, growth rates and physiological changes may impact future coral species assemblage and the reef framework robustness.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Corals|Ocean acidification|Calcification</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
