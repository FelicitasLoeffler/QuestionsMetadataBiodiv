Multiple alignments of amino acid sequences were made with Clustal Omega and trees were built with IQTree. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. Branches corresponding to genera and suggested subfamilies are delineated with colored squares and circles, respectively.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>virus taxonomy|bacteriophage taxonomy|Caudovirales|spounaviruses|phylogenetics|Herelleviridae</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
