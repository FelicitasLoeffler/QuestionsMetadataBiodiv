Optical clearing techniques can alleviate these mismatches, but they are so far limited to fixed samples. We present Iodixanol as a non-toxic medium supplement that allows refractive index matching in live specimens and thus a substantial improvement of the live-imaging of primary cell cultures, planarians, zebrafish and human cerebral organoids.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
