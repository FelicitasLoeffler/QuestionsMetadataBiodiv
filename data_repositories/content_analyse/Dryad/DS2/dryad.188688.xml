At present, with the increasing depth of mining, in-situ stress parameters is more and more important for coal mine. In this paper, a novel method for in-situ stress measurement with Kaiser effect was studied and applied in the Baijiao coal mine. First, we presented a comprehensive analysis method for the identification of Kaiser effect point. Then, a calculation method for in-situ stress measurement based on the Kaiser effect on acoustic emissions (AE) was suggested. After that, the in-situ stress test of Baijiao coal mine is taken as the research object, an experiment using AE monitoring during uniaxial compression testing (UCT) was performed to investigate the mechanical properties and AE characteristics. Finally, in-situ stress of the study area was calculated using the novel calculation method above and calculation results were verified using stress relief method and hydraulic fracturing method. The results showed that the calculation results obtained using the proposed method were valid and credible. Therefore, the calculation method for in-situ stress measurement and the proposed comprehensive analysis method using the Kaiser point could be applied for in-situ stress testing using the AE Kaiser effect method.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>In-situ stress|Kaiser effect|Acoustic emission|Uniaxial compression testing|Mechanical properties</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
