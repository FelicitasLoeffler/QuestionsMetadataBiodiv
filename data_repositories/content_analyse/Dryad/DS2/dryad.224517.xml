Additionally the FASTA file contains in-silico predicted protein sequences of the transcriptome of Micropterna lateralis (10.1080/01650424.2016.1200727). For the bioinformatics pipeline on how these protein sequences were generated from the original data see Material &amp; Methods in our publication. Additionally, the FASTA files contains heat shock protein sequences downloaded from NCBI (taxonomic scope Insecta, see publication). This file was used as a homology in-silico digested search space in MaxQuant to identify proteins in samples of Crunoecia irrorata reared at three different temperatures via LC-MS/MS.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Proteomics|Acclimation|Molecular adaptation|Phenotypic plasticity|Freshwater springs|Climate change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
