Mass loss unit = mg.day-1) and consumption unit = mg.g.day-1). Since the experiment was made with binary choices, each microcosm is constituted of 2 litter types(called A and B for clarity). A litter type is a litter species collected in a given land use treatment (fertilization - grazing). Mass loss was recorded for three millipede species (GM = Glomeris marginata, OR = Ommatoiulus rutilans, CC = Cylindroiulus caerulocinctus) and two litter species (Bromopsis erecta ex Bromus erectus and Potentilla verna). The land use treatments are exposed in detail in the article.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aboveground-belowground linkages|intraspecific trait variability|Litter-feeding macro-detritivores|litter quality|grazing|litter palatability</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
