A percentage score for these frames are recorded (ex. adult bees make up 50% of a frame)			the percentages for the colony are added together to get the final measurement. In order to reduce error associated with different workers measurements 		two people measure each colony and the final measurements are averaged (*note: in the CI study only one measurement was taken but this was recorded		twice to make it consistent with the existing R code)	- brood.coverage.A &amp; B = same measurement procedure as above but for brood instead of adult bees</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>disease transmission|host density</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
