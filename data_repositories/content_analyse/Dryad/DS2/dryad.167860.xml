For the coalescent-based methods, two types of gene trees were used as input: one with fully bifurcating gene trees, and one where branches were collapsed if they had less than 33% gene tree bootstrap support.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>phylogenetics|Artocarpus|alleles|incomplete lineage sorting|HybSeq|target enrichment|allele phasing</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
