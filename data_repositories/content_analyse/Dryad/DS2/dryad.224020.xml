The data file also includes the ID number (given by the museum), the sex of each specimen and the associated temperature values for the years in which they were collected (SST=average spring-summer temperature, AMT=annual mean temperature). Images were measured using ImageJ software, and high resolution images were provided to us by the Natural History Museum (London). Temperature data was obtained from the UK Meteorological Office (http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/summaries/datasets).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>temperature|size|sexual size dimorphism|ectotherm</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
