These infections are particularly interesting because they likely represent mutualistic endosymbionts, spreading by increasing host fitness. Here we document such a spread in the wAu infection of Drosophila simulans. By establishing multiple replicate cage populations, we show that wAu consistently increased from an intermediate frequency to near fixation, representing an estimated fitness advantage of around 20% for infected females.  The effective population size in the cages was estimated from SNP markers to be around a few thousand individuals, precluding large effects of genetic drift in the populations. The exact reasons for the fitness advantage are unclear but viral protection and nutritional benefits are two possibilities.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Fitness Advantage|Rapid Spread|Host Fitness|Cage Populations|Viral Protection</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
