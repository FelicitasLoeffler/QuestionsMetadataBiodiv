We show that female students underperformed on exams compared to their male counterparts across ten large introductory biology course sections in fall 2016 (N &gt; 1500 students). Females also reported higher levels of test anxiety and course-relevant science interest.&#160;Results from mediation analyses revealed an intriguing pattern: for female students only, and regardless of their academic standing, test anxiety negatively impacted exam performance, while interest in the course-specific science topics increased exam performance.  Thus, instructors seeking equitable classrooms can aim to decrease test anxiety and increase student interest in science course content. We provide strategies for mitigating test anxiety and suggestions for alignment of course content with student interest, with the hope of successfully&#160;reimagining the STEM pathway as one that is equally accessible to all.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
