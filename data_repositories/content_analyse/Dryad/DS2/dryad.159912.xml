Observations were spread across the site, and when possible, we conducted 90 minutes of observations throughout the period of insect activity, from mid-morning until early or late afternoon. Prior to each observation period, we selected a new set of flowers that we could observe simultaneously, marked them using a hula hoop or embroidery hoop (depending on floral density), and recorded the number of male- and female-phase flowers. During the observation period, we identified each visitor and counted the number of visits by that visitor by to male- and female-phase flowers. We used knowledge from multiple years of collecting (Williams et al. 2013) to identify A. erigeniae to species and sex, Bombylius major to species, generalist bees in the genera Lasioglossum, Ceratina, and Hylaeus to a group we called &#8220;small generalist bees&#8221;, cleptoparasitic bees in the genus Nomada to genus, and other visitors to species, genus, or morphological group to the best of our abilities.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>native bees|fly pollination|pollen depletion|pollinator-mediated selection|pollen presentation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
