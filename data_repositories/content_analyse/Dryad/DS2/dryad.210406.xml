By conducting a series of field, greenhouse, and growth chamber experiments, we examined how Costus villosissimus, a forest edge species, has adapted to drought and differentiated from C. allenii, its closely related species in the understory. We hypothesize that delayed seed germination and high drought tolerance may lead to habitat differentiation and thus reproductive isolation between closely related plant species in the tropics.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>drought escape strategy|drought tolerance|habitat isolation|local adaptation|seed germination.</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
