These are provided as TIF files, which are readable by FIJI. All imaging parameters are included in the image metadata. They are labeled by &#8220;Group#&#8221; (indicating which CDF they below to in the figure) and &#8220;Trial#&#8221; if multiple technical replicates were done for a given sample from a Group. The control done in Hanks&#8217; Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) is labeled as &#8220;HBSS&#8221;. Additionally, this file contains .csv files of all the statistics on particle sizes collected by the ImageJ macro. These are labeled in the format &#8220;Group#_trial#_automated_counting_statistics&#8221;. It also contains a .csv file of the particle # IDs of the singlet particles that were used to get the average singlet size, which was then used to normalize the ECDFs (as explained in detail in Materials and Methods). These are labeled in the format &#8220;Group#_trial#_singlet_IDs&#8221;. These .csv files were used in combination with the jupyter notebooks (also provided in this submission) to generate Figure 2, panels F-G. If multiple technical replicates were performed on a sample, the resulting ECDFs were combined to create one master ECDF for that sample.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>dietary fiber|small intestine|depletion interactions|flocculation|colloids|drug delivery</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
