The mortality is reported depending on raising temperature, treatment temperature, temperature variation populations were subjected to (raising temperature - treatment temperature) and the egg clutch individuals came from.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>developmental temperature|ectotherm|climate|temperature adaptation|acclimation|mortality</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
