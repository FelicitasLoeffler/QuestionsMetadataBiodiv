Herein we present an estimate of genome-wide microsatellite mutation rate in Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus) based on parent-offspring transmission patterns. We screened 307 individuals for parentage and mutation-rate analysis applying 43 variable markers. Out of 13,228 allele transfers, 11 mutations were detected, producing a mutation rate of 8.3x10-4 per locus per generation (95%CI: 1.48x10-3, 4.15x10-4). Single-step mutations predominated and there were trends toward mutations in loci with greater polymorphism and allele length. Two of the detected mutations were most probably cluster mutations, being identified in 12 and 28 sibs, respectively. Finally, we observed evidences of polyploidy based on the sporadic presence of 3 or 4 alleles per locus in the genotyped individuals, supporting previous reports of incomplete diploidization in Atlantic sturgeon.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>microsatellites</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
