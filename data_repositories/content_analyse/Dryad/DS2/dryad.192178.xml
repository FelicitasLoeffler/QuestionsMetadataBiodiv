We calculated several indices to test the influence of habitat heterogeneity on species assemblages. Structural heterogeneity in each stand was described with five indices: (1) the number of diameter classes (2-cm classes) for standing trees, combining live and dead individuals, (2) the amount of CWD, and (3) time-since-logging (stand age). We also estimated compositional heterogeneity through (4) the number of tree and shrub species, and (5) the dominant tree species in the stand. Age classes: C1, C2, C3, and C4 represent 4&#8211;20, 21&#8211;30, 31&#8211;50, and 51&#8211;70-years-old clear-cut stands, respectively, and OF is for old-growth forest of at least 120-years-old. The last index representing the dominant tree species in the stand is composed of three mutually exclusive classes: stands that were dominated by either spruce (EE) or fir (SS) species (species representing more than 60 % of basal area), and stands co-dominated by both spruce and fir (ES) species (species representing 40 to 60 % of basal area).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Community assembly|Forest succession|Habitat characteristics|Logging</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
