Oligomers of different sizes, morphology, and structures have been reported in both in vivo and in vitro studies, but there is a general lack of understanding about where to place these oligomers in the overall process of A&#946; aggregation and fibrillization. Here we show that A&#946;42 spontaneously forms oligomers with a wide range of sizes in the same sample. These A&#946;42 samples contain predominantly oligomers, and they quickly form fibrils upon incubation at 37&#176;C. When fractionated using ultrafiltration filters, the samples enriched with smaller oligomers form fibrils at a faster rate than the samples enriched with larger oligomers, with both a shorter lag time and faster fibril growth rate. This observation is independent of A&#946;42 batches and HFIP treatment. Furthermore, the fibrils formed by the samples enriched with larger oligomers are more readily solubilized by EGCG, a main catechin component of green tea. These results suggest that the fibrils formed by larger oligomers may adopt a different structure from fibrils formed by smaller oligomers, pointing to a link between oligomer heterogeneity and fibril polymorphism.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>amyloid|Alzheimer's disease|oligomerization|aggregation kinetics|neurodegeneration</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
