We applied our workflow to fecal DNA samples of an invertebrate-eating fish species. A fragment of the COI gene was amplified by combining two minibarcoding primer sets to maximize the taxonomic coverage. Amplicons were sequenced by an Illumina MiSeq platform. We developed a filtering approach based on a series of non-arbitrary thresholds established from control samples and from molecular replicates in order to address the elimination of cross-contamination, PCR/sequencing errors and mistagging artifacts. This resulted in a conservative and informative metabarcoding dataset. We developed a taxonomic assignment procedure that combines different approaches and that allowed the identification of ~75% of invertebrate COI variants to the species level. Moreover, based on the diversity of the variants, we introduced a semi-quantitative statistic in our diet study, the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), which is based on the number of distinct variants in each sample. The metabarcoding approach described in this paper may guide future diet studies that aim to produce robust datasets associated with a fine and accurate identification of prey items.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Diet studies|metabarcoding|COI|HTS data filtering|taxonomic assignment</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
