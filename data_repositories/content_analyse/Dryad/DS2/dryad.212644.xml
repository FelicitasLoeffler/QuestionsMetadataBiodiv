Simultaneously, among all different CMC reinforcements, Polymer-Derived Ceramic (PDC) fibers have gained attention for the intrinsic thermal stability and mechanical strength with simple and cost-effective synthesis techniques. Here, carbon-rich silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) fibers were synthesized via hand-drawing and polymer pyrolysis of a hybrid precursor of 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetravinyl-cyclotetrasilazane (TTCSZ) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). The type of silazane reported in this work is considered as a major precursor for SiCN, however it is unspinnable, due to its unfavorable physical properties (low viscosity) and chemical structure (cyclic rather than linear structure). The introduction of PAA to TTCSZ to create a hybrid precursor remarkably improved spinnability of the silazane and should be widely applicable to other unspinnable PDC preceramic polymers. Investigations on structural and compositional development of the fibers were mainly conducted via Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and ThermoGravimetric Analysis (TGA) to determine spinnability, free carbon content, cross-linking and pyrolysis behavior of the fibers, respectively.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>polymer derived ceramic|fibers|CMC|ceramics|polymers|Engineering|Chemistry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
