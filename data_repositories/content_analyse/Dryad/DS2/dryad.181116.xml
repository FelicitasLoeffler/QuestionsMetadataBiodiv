However, we do not know whether increased CO2 acts to exacerbate nutrient limitation on the fixation process itself. We experimentally test this idea by growing N2-fixing plants in pre-Industrial (280 ppm), present-day (400 ppm), and doubled (800 ppm) atmospheric CO2.Methods: In a greenhouse experiment, we grew tree seedlings from N2-fixing species and a non-fixing species at three CO2 concentrations with control, +P (phosphorus), +Mo (molybdenum), and +P+Mo nutrient treatments.Results: We found nutrient limitation to be minimal at pre-Industrial CO2, but with increasing CO2 fixer growth and fixation became increasingly limited by P and by a P-by-Mo interaction. At 400 ppm, plants with +P grew ~50% faster and fixed 10-15x more N2 based on nodule mass and nitrogenase activity. At 800 ppm, plants with +P+Mo grew 200% more, and fixed 25x more N2, suggesting Mo-P co-limitation at elevated CO2.Conclusion: Our findings imply that complex patterns of nutrient limitation can develop as CO2 rises, potentially suppressing tropical N2-fixation and new inputs of N needed to sustain the tropical carbon sink.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>CO2 fertilization|Molybdenum|Nutrient limitation|Phosphorous|Tropical carbon sink|Tropical nitrogen fixation|Global Change Ecology</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
