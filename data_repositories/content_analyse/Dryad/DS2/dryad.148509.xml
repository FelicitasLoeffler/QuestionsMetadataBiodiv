Data from the fitness test after removing juvenile and maternal effects. Females were placed individually on detached tomato and bean leaves for one generation. Dispersal treatments have 4 levels: 1 = 2mites/week, 2 = 3mites/week, 3 = 5mites/week, 4=10mites/week. Fecundity data for females that died of non-natural causes (drowned or disappeared) was excluded from the analysis (NA).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Experimental evolution|local adaptation|dispersal|interspecific competition|spider mites</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
