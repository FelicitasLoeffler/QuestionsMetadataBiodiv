Variables are organized in columns and named with the acronyms described in Table 1 and Table 2. The first two columns identify the tree and the disc respectively. Every row corresponds to the value of an individual ring.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>axial scaling|cell wall thickness|elevated CO2|ray parenchyma|soil warming|structure-function relationship|tracheid lumen size|tree-ring anatomy</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
