Some data refer to presence-absence data (0-absent, 1-present) and some to abundance data (column Data). Occurrences are partitioned into mainland-shelf and island-shelf occurrences (column Shelf.island). Some occurrences are based on photographic surveys. The column "Survey" refers to monitoring of wastewater agencies (LA City, LA County, Orange County, Point Loma, and South Bay), to Bight-wide surveys, to photographic USGS surveys, or Melville 2012 survey (performed by authors of this study).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>historical ecology|conservation paleobiology|Southern California Bight|amino-acid racemization|watershed history|community paleoecology</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
