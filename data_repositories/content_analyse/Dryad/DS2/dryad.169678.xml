However, over-exploitation has led to profound stock declines in some regions such as Scandinavia and the Mediterranean. To manage this resource sustainably, knowledge of population structure and connectivity is crucial to inform management about dispersal, recruitment, stock identification and food traceability. We used restriction-site associated DNA sequencing to develop novel SNP markers from 55 individuals encompassing much of the species range, SNPs were quality filtered, ranked using F-statistics and the top 96 SNPs adequate for primer design were retained. SNP markers were developed with the aim of maximising the power to detect genetic differentiation between: (i) Atlantic and Mediterranean lobsters and (ii) Atlantic lobsters. This panel of SNPs provides a useful resource for future studies of population genetic structure and assignment in H. gammarus.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>conservation genetics|fisheries management|population assignment|RAD-seq|SNPs</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
