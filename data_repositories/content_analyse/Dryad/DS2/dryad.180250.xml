We also experimentally distinguished the relative contribution of above- (canopy) and below-ground (soil) effects of C. galianoi on the most frequent subordinate species, Festuca indigesta, as well as the reciprocal effects of F. indigesta on C. galianoi.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bi-directional interactions|Competition|Facilitation|Feedback effects|Niche construction|Phenotypic variability|Physiological status</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
