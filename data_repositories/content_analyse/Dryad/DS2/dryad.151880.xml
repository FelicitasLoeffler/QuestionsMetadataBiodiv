This right talus is the first discovery of non-dental skeletal material of Donrussellia provincialis, the most primitive fossil species belonging to the order Euprimates at present time.These RTI files enable a visualisation of the specimen in a high resolution photographic quality, for five orientations, with interactive re-lighting capturing surface, shape and color.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Talus|Grasp-leaping|Functional morphology|Geometric morphometrics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
