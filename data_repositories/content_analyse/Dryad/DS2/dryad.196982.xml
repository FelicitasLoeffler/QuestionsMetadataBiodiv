For each sequence it makes a string containing all the species hits that had the lowest e value for that query. Script removes hits with % identity of query cover &lt; 90. Script also prints if an ASV had no BLAST results or if all e values were equal to the minimum. Returns a table with columns: Sample, Species (String of lowest e value hits), N ASVs, N reads, Proportion of reads, Sequence name (from sample results file).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>population genetics|invasion genetics|microsatellites|mitochondrial DNA|environmental DNA|eDNA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
