The humidity version used is the max. The variables have been built using the same protocol as WorldClim with data from MERRA. Temperature layers (BIO1-BIO11) are in degree Celsius multiplied by 10, humidity layers (BIO12-BIO19) are in kg of water/kg of air multiplied by 100000.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>bioclimatic|MERRAclim|macroecology|biogeography</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
