The file includes metadata for 1027 replicates, 10 reef community metrics used to define regimes in a cluster analysis, and the resulting reef regime. Reef community metrics are averages of individual replicates grouped based on spatial proximity. Details of the analysis can be found in the accompanying publication. Parties interested in using this data for other purposes are asked to contact Mary Donovan (donovan.maryk@gmail.com).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>coral|macroalgae|regime shift|model-based clustering</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
