The ID for each locus is the ID allocated to each marker by the program Stacks 1.3.5. The sequence in the SEQ field is the consensus tag sequence for each marker, exported from Stacks 1.3.5. Mapping was performed with bowtie 2.2.6.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Speciation|Indirect selection|Introgression|Linked selection|Mimulus</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
