Contains data used to argue that even when controlling for colony expansion velocity's plate-to-plate variability, the wall velocity of one strain sweeping through another is vastly overestimated by standard "geometric optics" predictions. The data in this repository was used to generate all Figures and Tables in Appendix S2. See the README for additional information.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>genetic drift|selection|range expansion|stochastic|random walkers|microbe|E. coli</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
