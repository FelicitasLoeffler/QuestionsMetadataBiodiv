Immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions amplified from cDNA made by RACE with barcoded 5' template switch adapters.  NEBnext amplicon sequenced using 400x100 paired end reads on the Illumina MiSeq. This is read 1 (R1)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>HIV vaccine|antibody repertoire|HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies|HIV bnAbs genome editing|B cells|PG9</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
