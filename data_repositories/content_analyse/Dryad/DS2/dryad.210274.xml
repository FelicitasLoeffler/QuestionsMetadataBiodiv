This dataset included all 95 entries from the smaller dataset described above, and an additional 35 entries, for a grand total of 130 entries. For each entry, we recorded whether the longer time period increased or decreased fitness relative to the short time period, using the equation: (w2 &#8211; w0 or wcontrol2) &#8211; (w1 &#8211; w0 or wcontrol1) = differenceThis difference was recorded as &#8220;positive&#8221;, &#8220;negative&#8221; or 0. This was done for each of the 130 entries. We then created a collapsed database, with only one entry per combination of study, species, and conservation strategy (noting that some studies included multiple species or strategies). If all entries for a study or species or strategy had differences (as above) that were positive, we assigned that entry as &#8220;positive&#8221;, and similarly for differences that were all &#8220;negative&#8221;. If some entries were positive and others were negative for a given study/species/strategy, we assigned that entry a 0, meaning we were unable to conclusively determine whether the conservation implementation was beneficial over the long term.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|translocation|genetic rescue|gene flow|Hybridization|evolutionary rescue|demographic rescue|transgenerational plasticity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
