Results of phylogenetic analysis of Nanobamus macrorhinus in the matrix of Schoch (2019) (35 taxa, 108 characters), tree visually pruned to focus on Amphibamiforms. (1) majority rule consensus of the first 107-character (removal of character 17) sampling permutation, (2) strict consensus tree of the same permutation with bootstrap support and Bremer decay index (the latter in parentheses), (3) majority rule consensus of the second 107-character sampling (removal of character 30) permutation, (4) strict consensus tree of the same permutation with bootstrap support and Bremer decay index.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Amphibamiformes|Temnospondyli</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
