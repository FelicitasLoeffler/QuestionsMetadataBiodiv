Plant Cell 10.1105/tpc.16.00961.Supplemental Dataset 2. Cluster designations for differentially expressed transcripts. The table lists the TAIR10 AGI IDs and descriptions (as Supplemental Dataset 1), whether these are classed as transcriptional regulators for network analysis (&#8216;TF category&#8217;) and the cluster numbers for DE transcripts. In addition, transcripts that are differentially expressed in both CU and PU (&#8216;Core CU/PU&#8217;), are &#8216;N-response&#8217; marker genes, clock genes or are CTSEs in cortex or pericycle are indicated (as referred to in the text).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Root architecture and plasticity|Nitrogen responses|Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting|Plant responses to the environment|Root cell types|Rhizobia responses|Cell identity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
