We show results from observations of aniline blue stained pistils after three types of crosses, interspecific (Inter), Intraspecific (Intra), and self-cross (Self). The self compatibility phenotype of plants, as determined from seed counts (see methods), is provided: SC = self compatible, SI = self incompatible. Pistils were processed in batches, this information is included in the &#8220;Batchr&#8221; column.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Interspecific incompatibility|pollen-pistil interactions|pollen-pistil adhesion|reproductive barriers|self-incompatibility|SIxSC rule</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
