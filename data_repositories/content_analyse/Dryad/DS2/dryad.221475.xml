We developed an acoustic data analysis method based on active sound production by larvae (i.e. stridulations) for gaining new insights into larval ecology. In a laboratory study, third instar larvae of the Common Cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha) (n = 38) and the Forest Cockchafer (M. hippocastani) (n = 15) kept in soil-filled containers were acoustically monitored for 5 min each, resulting in the first known stridulation recordings for each species. Subsequent continuous monitoring of three M. hippocastani larvae over several hours showed that a single larva could stridulate more than 70 times per hour, and stridulation rates increased drastically with increasing larval abundance. The new fractal dimension-based data analysis method automatically detected audio sections with stridulations and provided a semi-quantitative estimate of stridulation activity. It is the first data analysis method specifically targeting Scarabaeidae larvae stridulations in soils, enabling for the first time non-invasive species-specific pest monitoring.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>soil audio recordings|larval stridulations|incidental larval sounds</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
