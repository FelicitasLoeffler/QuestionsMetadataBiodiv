The underlying cause of these disruptions is thought to stem from alterations of ion gradients (HCO3Cl) across neuronal cell membranes that occur as a consequence of maintaining pH homeostasis via the accumulation of HCO3Cl. While behavioural impacts are widely documented, few studies have measured acid-base parameters in species showing behavioural disruptions. In addition, current studies examining mechanisms lack resolution in targeting specific neural pathways corresponding to a given behaviour. With these considerations in mind, acid-base parameters and behaviour were measured in a model organism utilized for decades as a research model to study learning, the California sea hare (Aplysia californica). Aplysia exposed to CO2 elevated hemolymph HCO3Cl, achieving full and partial pH compensation at 1200 and 3000 &#956;atm CO2, respectively. Increased CO2 did not affect self-righting behaviour. In contrast, both levels of elevated CO2 reduced the time of the tail-withdrawal reflex, suggesting a reduction in antipredator response. Overall, these results confirm that Aplysia are promising models to examine mechanisms underlying CO2-induced behavioural disruptions since they regulate HCO3-Cl- and have behaviours linked to neural networks amenable to electrophysiological testing.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>CO2|mollusc|carbon dioxide|climate change|Aplysia|sea hare</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
