However, the structures of large golden cage doped with Mo and Tc are still not well-known because of the challenges in global structural searches. Here we report anionic and neutral golden cage doped with a transition-metal atom MAu16 (M=Mo and Tc) using Saunders &#8220;Kick&#8221; stochastic automation search method associated with density-functional theory calculation (SK-DFT). The geometric structures and electronic properties of the doped clusters, MAu16q (M=Mo and Tc, q=0 and &#8722;1) are investigated by means of DFT theoretical calculations. Our calculations confirm that the 4d transition-metal Mo and Tc can be stably encapsulated in the Au16&#8722; cage, forming in three different configurations, i.e. endohedral cages, planar structures and exohedral derivatives. The ground-state structures of endohedral cages C2v Mo@Au16&#8211; &#8211;(a) and C1 Tc@Au16 &#8211;&#8211;(b) exhibit a marked stability, as judged by their high binding energy per atom (&gt;2.46 eV), doping energy (0.29 eV) as well as a large HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap (&gt;0.40 eV). The predicted photoelectron spectra should aid future experimental characterization of MAu16&#8211; (M= Mo and Tc).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>nanocluster|structure|density-functional theory|stability|photoelectron spectra</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
