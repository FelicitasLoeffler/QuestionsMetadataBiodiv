Data includes extra-nest activity, exploratory activity, recruitment to artificial nectar and crickets, foraging activity at a stable dry diet, and weight of dry diet collected. Data also includes qPCR expression data for Solenopsis invicta foraging (sifor) relative to actin. Data was collected from standardized colony replicates in a standardized laboratory environment.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Behavior/Social Evolution|Ecological Genetics|intraspecific variation|superorganism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
