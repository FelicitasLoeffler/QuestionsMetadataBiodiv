How to reduce the cost of support materials has always been a hot topic in this field. Herein, for the development of low-cost immobilized lipase, we demonstrate an amphiphilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) grafted on silicone particles (SP) surface materials (SP-PVP) with rational design based on interfacial activation and solution polymerization. Meanwhile, the hydrophilic pristine SP and hydrophobic polystyrene-corded silicone particles (SP-Pst) were also prepared for lipase immobilization. The SP-PVP were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. Our results indicated that the lipase loading amount on the SP-PVP composites was about 215 mg of protein per g. In the activity assay, the immobilized lipase SP-PVP@CRL exhibited higher catalysis activity, better thermostability and reusability than that of SP@CRL and SP-Pst@CRL. The immobilized lipase retained more than 54 % of its initial activities after 10 times reuse and approximately trended to a steady in the following cycles. By introducing the interesting amphiphilic polymer to these cheap and easily obtained silicone particles (SP) surface, the relative performance of immobilized lipase can be significantly improved, rendering interactions between the low cost supports materials and lipase.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>amphiphilic polyvinylpyrrolidone|silicone particles|immobilization|lipase</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
