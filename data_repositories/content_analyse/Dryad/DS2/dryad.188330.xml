The output in each vial is the sum of focal and ebony flies eclosed for each week.  Numbers in column headings represents weeks since start of experiment. NA represents no counting due to all focal flies being deceased. For week 9 all ebony competitors for the male focals were at least 200. The number of offspring eclosed came from a number of parents in the vial recorded in the Lifespan file for focal flies and the Competitors file for ebony competitors.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Drosophila|Inbreeding|Life history: aging|Life history: evolution|Life history: trade offs|Resource allocation|Selection: sexual|Senescence|Sexual dimorphism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
