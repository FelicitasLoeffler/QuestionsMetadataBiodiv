Snowdepths have been measured from west to east at every 50 cm, at three dates in the springs of 2013 and 2014. Soil temperatures measured in the center of non-sorted circles at approximately -1 cm in the autumn-spring of 2012-2013, and autumn-mid summer 2013-2014. 'ctrl' plots are unmanipulated, 'fleece' plots were covered with gardening fleeces, and 'snow' plots had snow added by use of a stone wall catching snow.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>cryoturbation|plant phenology|winter climate change|shrubs|snow cover|spring climate|snowmelt timing</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
