The first column represents the frequency of mm, the second column represents the frequency of Mm, and the third column represents the frequency of MM. Each row represents a generation. NAs represent untracked generations after fixation has already occurred.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Mating systems|Heterosis|Self-fertilization|Inbreeding</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
