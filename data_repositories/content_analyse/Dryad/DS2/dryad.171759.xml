We extracted data for 88 plots from three studies within the Victorian Tall Eucalypt Forest Plot Network. The plots had varying degrees of disturbance in terms of fire and logging. We established three survey points in each plot and recorded bird species present at each survey point over the period 2009 to 2016 on one or more occasions.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>forest birds|Mountain Ash|post-fire salvage logging|variable retention harvest systems|wildfire|natural disturbance</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
