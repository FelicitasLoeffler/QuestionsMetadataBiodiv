SNPs on contigs that are not part of the 10 chromosomes are coded as being on chromosome 11, and SNPs on RTAs are coded as being on chromosome 12.widiv_942g_column_name_converter.txt - Converts genotype names between unimputed (column 'Original') and imputed (column 'NoSpaces').</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
