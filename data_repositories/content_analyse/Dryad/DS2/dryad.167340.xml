"Relatedness with plant species in native community influences ecological consequences of range expansions". First sheet "Community level biomass" contains above-and belowground biomass (g) of plant communities in each mesocosm. Second sheet "Biomass of individual plants" contains aboveground biomass of each plant individual in each mesocosm. Third sheet "Chemistry of individual plants" contains C and N content of Brassicacea plants in this experiment. Fourth sheet "Herbivore weight" contains the weight and relative growth rate of herbivores in this experiment.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Climate change|plant-plant interaction|plant-herbivore interaction|plant-soil interaction</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
