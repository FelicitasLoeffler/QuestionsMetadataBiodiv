The compressed folder contains images for the wild type (WT_secrGFP.tif) and the general secretion secondary screening of the 88 intracellular retention hits in the primary Collagen IV screening (gene symbol_secrGFP.tif). Apart from the general secretion marker (secr.GFP) in green, plasma membrane is shown in red (myr.RFP) and nuclei in blue (DAPI). Images were acquired in a Zeiss LSM780 microscope with a 63x oil immersion objective.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Collagen IV|COPII vesicles|RNAi screening|secretory pathway|Rab-GTPases|ER exit site</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
