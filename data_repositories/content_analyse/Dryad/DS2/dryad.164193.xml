Delimiting this cryptic diversity is challenging, both because the divergences span a continuum and because the lack of overt morphological differentiation suggests divergence has proceeded heterogeneously. Here, we address these challenges as we diagnose and describe species in three co-occurring species groups of Australian lizards. By integrating genomic and morphological data with data on hybridization and introgression from contact zones, we explore several approaches &#8211; and their relative benefits and weaknesses &#8211; for testing the validity of cryptic lineages. More generally, we advocate that genetic delimitations of cryptic diversity must consider whether these lineages are likely to be durable and persistent through evolutionary time.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>cryptic species|species delimitation|squamates|phylogeography|exome capture|taxonomy</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
