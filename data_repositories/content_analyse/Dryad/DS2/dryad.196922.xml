Tuning these steps kinetics by the action of, e.g., transcription factors, allows for a wide diversity of dynamics. For example, adding autoregulation generates single-gene circuits able to perform more complex tasks. Using stochastic models of transcription kinetics with empirically validated parameter values, we investigate how autoregulation and the multi-step transcription initiation kinetics of single-gene autoregulated circuits can be combined to fine tune steady state mean and cell-to-cell variability in protein expression levels, as well as response times. Next, we investigate how they can be jointly tuned to control complex behaviors, namely, time counting, switching dynamics, and memory storage. Overall, our finding suggests that, in bacteria, jointly regulating a single-gene circuit&#8217;s topology and the transcription initiation multi-step dynamics allows enhancing complex task performance.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Transcription initiation|cell to cell variability|autoregulation mechanisms|stochastic models</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
