Columns include: 'Plant' (unique ID associated with each rosette, numbers are not consecutive due to attrition before planting and plants that were excluded due to faulty irrigation), 'Population' (unique ID associated with each population, numbers are also not consecutive due to attrition before planting and plants that were excluded due to faulty irrigation), 'Origin' (continental range of seed collection, North American or European), 'Block' (1 or 2, a spatial block that coincides with maternal line), 'Treatment' (Ambient or Reduced Herbivory), 'PC1' (Principle Component associated mainly with temperature), 'PC2' (Principle Component associated mainly with precipitation during warm or wet periods), 'PC3' (Principle Component associated mainly with precipitation during warm and dry periods), 'Rosette.Area' (cm^2), 'Alive' (indicates where the rosette survived [1] or died [0] before September of the first growing season), 'Survival.to.Beginning.of.the.Second.Growing.Season' (0=no, 1=yes), 'Young.Leaf.Chewing.Damage' (estimate of average percent leaf tissue removed on young leaves by insect herbivores), 'Binomial.Young.Leaf.Chewing.Damage' (0=no visible damage, 1=visible damage on young leaves), 'Old.Leaf.Average.Chewing.Damage' (estimate of average percent leaf tissue removed on old leaves by insect herbivores), Binomial.Old.Leaf.Chewing.Damage (0=no visible damage, 1=visible damage on young leaves), 'Garden' (Garden Location, either U.S. or Czech Republic).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>abiotic clines|common garden|EICA|invasion ecology|plant-climate interactions|plant-herbivore interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
