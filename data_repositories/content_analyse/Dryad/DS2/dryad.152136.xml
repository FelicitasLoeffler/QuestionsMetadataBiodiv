For each trial, it includes the sinuosity both before and after an experimental manipulation. The manipulation was to exert on the object being carried the pulling force of one or two infinitely persistent F. podzolica ants. For each trial, the data file includes the colony ID, the mass of the object being carried, the treatment (force of one ant, two ants, or control with no force added), whether the record is for before of after the manipulation, and the sinuosity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>collective behavior|cooperative transport|persistence|collective decision|emergent behavior</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
