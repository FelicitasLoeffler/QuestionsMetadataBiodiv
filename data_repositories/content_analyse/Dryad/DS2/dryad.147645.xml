Data include information on the progeny trial (called landscape in the datafile), block,soil type, planting spacing, age at measurement in years, followed by the trait data, mean annual volume growth increment (MAI), basic wood density (BWD) and screened cellulose pulp yield (SPY). Please note that SNP data were available only for 768 trees of these 856 phenotyped trees as described in the paper</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Genomic Prediction|SNPs|GBLUP|tree breeding|wood traits|growth traits</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
