Individuals with &#8216;fast&#8217; lifestyles should develop faster, reproduce earlier and exhibit more risky behaviours. Evidence for such predicted links, however, remains equivocal. Here, I test how growth rate, timing of maturation, litter size and maternal effort correlate with exploration, boldness, fearlessness, docility and escape latency. I found several links that were predicted by recent theory while others were against theoretical predictions, e.g. fast growing individuals were more fearful. Thus, while I found personality to be integrated with life-history, I cannot fully support recent hypotheses aiming to explain such behaviour-life-history associations.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Animal personality|Pace-of-life syndromes|life-history productivity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
