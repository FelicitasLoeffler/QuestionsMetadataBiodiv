We evaluated whether initial corticosterone and estimates of body condition (i.e., scaled mass index and fat score) measured during winter predicted reproductive investment in the subsequent breeding season. Some birds were sampled twice during winter, but we only used the first measurement of winter CORT, fat, and scaled mass index to investigate these cross-seasonal relationships. The data file also contains a README tab containing variable definitions.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>carry-over effect|repeatability|reproduction|non-migratory bird|energy allocation|glucocorticoid</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
