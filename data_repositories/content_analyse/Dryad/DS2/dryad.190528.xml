Predicting the response should be straightforward using models that describe population growth as a function of competitor densities, but these models require accurate estimates of interaction strengths. Here, we quantified how well we could predict responses to competitor removal in a community of annual plants, using a combination of observation and experiment. It was straightforward to fit models to multi-species communities, which passed standard diagnostic tests and provided apparently sensible estimates of interaction strengths. However, the models consistently underpredicted the response to competitor removal, by a factor of at least 50%. We argue that this poor predictive ability is likely to be general in plant communities due to &#8216;the ghost of competition present&#8217; that confines species to parts of the environment in which they compete best.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>plant competition|species coexistence|community assembly|niches|population dynamics|community dynamics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
