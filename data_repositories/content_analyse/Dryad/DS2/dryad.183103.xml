We characterised the activity of putative cerebellar Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and mossy fibres in awake mice engaged in an active locomotion task, using high-density silicon electrode arrays. Analysis of the activity of over 300 neurons in response to locomotion revealed that the majority of cells (53%) were significantly modulated by phase of the stepping cycle. However, in contrast to studies involving passive locomotion on a treadmill, we found that a high proportion of cells (45%) were tuned to the speed of locomotion, and 19% were tuned to yaw movements. The activity of neurons in the cerebellar vermis provided more information about future speed of locomotion than about past or present speed, suggesting a motor, rather than purely sensory, role. We were able to accurately decode the speed of locomotion with a simple linear algorithm, with only a relatively small number of well-chosen cells needed, irrespective of cell class. Our observations suggest that behavioural state modulates cerebellar sensorimotor integration, and advocate a role for the cerebellar vermis in control of high-level locomotor kinematic parameters such as speed and yaw.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
