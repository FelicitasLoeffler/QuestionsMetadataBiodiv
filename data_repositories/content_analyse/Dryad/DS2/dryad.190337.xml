Any stop that contained multiple species is listed twice (e.g. if stop 1 contained C. xantiana and C. unguiculata, there are two separate entries in the file--stop 1: X and stop 1: U). Species were abbreviated as follows: C = Clarkia cylindrica, D = C. dudleyana, E = C. exilis, P = C. xantiana ssp. parviflora, S = C. speciosa, U = C. unguiculata, X = C. xantiana ssp. xantiana.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>competition|facilitation|pollinator-mediated selection|floral traits|community assembly|allopatry|sympatry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
