Aboveground competition forms spatial light gradients, but the role of resource sharing in such competition is unclear. We examined translocation of resources between mother and daughter ramets of Agrostis stolonifera under light heterogeneity throughout ramet ontogeny. We labelled ramets by 13C and 15N to estimate bidirectional translocation of the resources at three developmental stages of daughters. Besides, we compared final biomass of integrated and severed ramets to estimate the effect of integration on growth. Young developing daughters were supported by carbon, whereas nitrogen was only translocated towards daughters at the beginning of rooting, regardless of the light conditions. Shading of mothers was a major determinant of resource translocation between developed ramets, with carbon being preferentially moved to daughters from shaded mothers while nitrogen translocation being limited from daughters to shaded mothers. Surprisingly, absolute amounts of translocated resources did not decline through development. Growth of daughters was enhanced by integration regardless of the shading.Apparently, A. stolonifera maximizes the resource translocation pattern which enables it to spread from unfavourable habitats rather than compensate for light heterogeneity among ramets.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>carbon|clonal plant|light|nitrogen|ontogeny|physiological integration|stable isotopes|translocation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
