C, E. oblonga, E. sp. A, E. mathaei, E. sp. EZ, our sample, the COI sequence extracted from the published E. mathaei mitogenome (denoted with an asterisk), and E. lucunter as an outgroup. We used a MAFFT alignment and an E-INS-i algorithm to align COI sequences (441 column nucleotide alignment) in Geneious v11.1.4. Accession numbers are to the right of the species name.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Sea urchin|Species complex|Mitochondrial genome</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
