Understanding the temporal variations of NPP could provide new insights into the responses of communities to environmental factors, whilst also contributing to a better assessment of regional carbon storage. However, few studies based on long-term field biomass measurements have directly addressed this subject in the unique environment of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau (QTP). we examined the interannual variations of NPP during 2008-2015 by monitoring both aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and identified their relationships with environmental factors by adopted the general linear model (GLM)and structural equation model (SEM). In addition, the interannual variation of root turnover and its controls were also investigated. The results show that the ANPP and BNPP increased by rates of 15.01 g/m2 and 143.09 g/m2 per year during 2008-2015, respectively. BNPP was mainly affected by growing season air temperature (GST) and growing season precipitation (GSP) rather than mean annual air temperature (MAT) or mean annual precipitation (MAP), while ANPP was only controlled by GST. In addition, available nitrogen (AN) was significant positively associated with BNPP and ANPP. Root turnover rate averaged 30% /yr, increased with soil depth, and was largely controlled by GST. Our results suggest that alpine Kobresia meadow was an N-limited ecosystem, the NPP on the QTP might increase further in the future in the context of global warming and nitrogen deposition.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
