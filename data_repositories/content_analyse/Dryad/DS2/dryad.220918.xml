In the experiment, eggs were artificially fertilized, and a split-brood design with three different temperature treatments was used to test for effects of temperature during early fry development. Four offspring performance measures (hatching success, fry survival during the first 5 days, day degrees until hatching, and fry body length 5 days post hatch) were quantified. Data on hatching success and fry survival is presented in &#8216;performance.xlsx&#8217;, data on day degrees until hatching in &#8216;daydegrees.xlsx&#8217;, and data on fry body length in &#8216;lengths.xlsx&#8217;.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>adaptation|temperature|pike</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
