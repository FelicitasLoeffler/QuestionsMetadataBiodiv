The "Data"-file contains the following information: "CCA - Bryophytes/Lichens/Groundveg" contain the species tables (abbreviations in Appendix S4), "CCA - Bryophytes/Lichens/Groundveg - Stages" the calculated relative dominance of a stage on a sampling unit, which were used for the CCA analysis. "ISA - Bryophytes/Lichens" and "ISA - Bryophytes/Lichens -DBH"contain the data used for the indicator species analysis in order to detect a significant preference of epiphyte species to certain stem diameters (dbh) (living and dead standing trees). "ISA - Downed BL" and "ISA - Downed BL - DBH" contain the same information for epiphytes on downed deadwood. "Mean Species Number" provides the number of Plants, bryophytes and lichens in each forest development stage. "Downed deadwood - Mean species" provides the number of bryophytes and lichens in each forest development stage on downed deadwood. "RE - Curves - Bryophytes/Lichens/Plants" provide the data used for the rarefaction/extrapolation curves in order to compare the species richness between the three forest development stages and the production forest. "DBH - Species" and "DBH - Species - Production" contain the number of epiphytic bryophyte and lichen species in the primeval and production forest used for the GLM analysis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>bryophytes|forest management|habitat heterogeneity|lichens|Determinants of plant community diversity and structure|primeval forests|vascular plants|disturbance|forest development stages</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
