The dataset includes functional responses on their own lines (e.g. multiple functional responses could be recorded at one site, within one publication), and includes information on: publication, exclosure experiment, and which ecosystem function was examined.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>carbon cycle|ecosystem function|ecosystem resilience and resistance|exclosure experiment|large herbivore loss|nutrient cycling|plant regeneration|primary productivity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
