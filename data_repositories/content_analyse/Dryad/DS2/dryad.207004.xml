Values: Old secondary forest, Near primary forest, Young secondary forest, Swamp, Riparian forest1-e) Plant ID: the unique identification of each individual plant1-f) Plant form: Tree, liana, strangler (Ficus spp)1-g) Species traits: the plant consumption traits indicating whether the species is preferred or fallback (see the main article, Table 2). Values: Preferred gorilla (preferred by gorillas only), Preferred chimpanzee (preferred by chimpanzee only), Preferred apes (preferred by both gorillas and chimpanzees), Fallback gorilla (fallback for gorillas only), Fallback apes (fallback for both gorillas and chimpanzees), UC (unclassified), NA (no species was found in the plot)1-h) Scientific names genus level: the scientific names of the species, determined at the genus level in faecal samples for genus with several species consumed by great apes1-i) Scientific names species level: the scientific names of species, determined at the species level, excepted for unidentified species1-j) Family: the family names of species 1-k) DBH: the diameter at breast height of the individual plant (in centimetre)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Fallback food|Habitat selection|Ecological niche|Fruit preference|Fruit phenology|Niche partitioning in primates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
