Species measured include the Noisy Friarbird, Magpie-lark, Red Wattlebird, and Pacific Koel eggs from Red Wattlebird nests. Eggs were measured from 2013-2015. The first sheet contains the average spectrophotometric data for each wavelength from 300-700 nm, which was used to calculate the color catchcone values (second sheet). The second sheet contains the color catchcone values for the four avian color cones (VS, SWS, MWS, and LWS) and the double cone for luminance. Catchcone values were used to calculate Just Noticeable Differences to compare egg colors and luminance values between species. For more information about each clutch, please see the supplemental material in the manuscript. For more information about the analyses, please see the Methods and Results section in the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>brood parasitism|coevolution|egg mimicry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
