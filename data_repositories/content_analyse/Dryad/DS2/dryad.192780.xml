Each line contains an individual ID, the year of reproductive performance, the morph (white-striped or tan-striped), the sex, the number of mates for that year, the number of offspring produced for that year, and the number of social versus extra-pair mates.  In addition, for each individual, lifetime reproductive success, and the number of mates averaged across the lifespan is given.  In the columns "Mates2" and "SocMates2", social mates with which an individual did not produce genetic offspring were not assigned as mates.  In the primary analysis (i.e. in the "Mates" and "Soc Mates Yr" columns), these social mates were assigned as mates, as explained in the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bateman Gradients|Polymorphic species|Sexual Selection|white-throated sparrows|extra pair mating</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
