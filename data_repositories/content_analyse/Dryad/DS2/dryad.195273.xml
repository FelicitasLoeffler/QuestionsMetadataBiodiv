Corn yields may be greaterwith higher than recommended soil test P when springs are relatively wetand cool. Research was conducted across 12 irrigated and five rainfed siteyrin Nebraska with initial Bray-1 P &#8804; 11 mg kg&#8211;1 to evaluate P applicationstrategies for yield and P uptake of continuous corn (Zea mays L.) with and without tillage. The fertilizer P treatments were maintained on the same plots and included: (i) no P applied (0P), (ii) P applied according to the Universityof Nebraska-Lincoln deficiency correction recommendation (UNL_P), (iii) P applied to replace P removed in the previous harvest (Replace_P), (iv) Bray-1 P increased and maintained at 25 mg kg&#8211;1 (Bray_25), and (v) Bray-1 P increased and maintained at 35 mg kg&#8211;1 (Bray_35). Interactions of P practice with other factors were not significant indicating consistency of P practice effects across varied climate conditions near planting and plant emergence. Grain yield was 9.3% and 0.89 Mg ha&#8211;1 more with the P-applied treatments compared with 0P. Grain yield was 3.3% more due to the additional 5.9 kg ha&#8211;1 yr&#8211;1 P applied with Replace_P compared with UNL_P. Grain yield did not differ for Replace-P, Bray_25, and Bray_35. Plant P uptake was on average linearly increased by 0.27 kg kg&#8211;1 P applied. Fertilizer P application for continuous corn should be by Replace_P.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Phosphorus|maize|high soil P</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
