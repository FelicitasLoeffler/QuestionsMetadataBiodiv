However, the capture of wild animals continues for many purposes where conservation is not the primary focus. Wild-capture hinders long-term conservation goals by reducing remaining wild populations. Furthermore, the direct and long-term indirect consequences of wild-capture for captive population viability are rarely addressed using longitudinal data. We explored the implications of changes in wild-capture on population dynamics in captivity over 54 years using a multi-generational studbook of working Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in Myanmar, the largest remaining captive elephant population. Here we show that population growth and birth rates declined between 1960 and 2014 with declines in wild-capture. Importantly, wild-caught females had reduced birth rates and higher mortality risk. However, despite the disadvantages of wild-capture, the population may not be sustainable without it, with immediate declines due to an unstable age-structure that may last for 50 years. Our results highlight the need to assess the long-term demographic consequences of wild-capture to ensure the sustainability of captive populations as species are increasingly managed and conserved in altered or novel environments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Individual-based model|Population viability|Demography|Ex-situ conservation|Life-history</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
