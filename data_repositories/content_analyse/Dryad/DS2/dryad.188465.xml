Sheet 1 contains information on the samples, linking PCR IDs to molecular identifiers (MIDs), sequencing pool (A/B) and design variables (treatment, landscape etc). Negatives and repetitions are also listed here. Sheet 2 lists the barcodes for MIDs 1-100, and the oligos when combined with fITS7 or ITS4. Sheet 3 lists the barcodes for MIDs 246-345, and the oligos when combined with fITS7 or ITS4.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Top-down|saproxylic|insects|decomposition|dead wood|community assembly|high-throughput sequencing|DNA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
