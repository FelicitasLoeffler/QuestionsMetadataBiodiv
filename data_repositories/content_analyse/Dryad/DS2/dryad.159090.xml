The geographic coordinates of patches are also listed in the "Juneau_Yellow_Cedar_Stand_Locations.csv" file in this data package and are shown in Figure 1. A companion manuscript, Krapek, J., Hennon, P.E., D'Amore, D.V., and Buma, B. "Despite available habitat at range edge, yellow-cedar migration is punctuated with a past pulse tied to colder conditions." Diversity and Distributions, 2017, describes yellow-cedar stand and patch mapping methodology in detail.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>dispersal|biotic interactions|climate change|punctuated range extension|range shift|yellow-cedar|competition|persistence niche</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
