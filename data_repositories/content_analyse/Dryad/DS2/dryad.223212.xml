The carbonaceous species of pre-coked samples before and after MTP reactions were investigated by elementary analysis and Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA). The results showed that pre-coke formed at low temperature (250 &#8451;) was unstable and easily to transform into polyaromatics species at the high reacting temperature. While combing 5% pre-coking process with 95% stream treatment at high temperature (480 &#8451;) was effective in inhibiting the formation of coke deposits and presented an significant improvement in the propylene selectivity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Pre-coking|ZSM-5|Methanol to Propylene|catalyst</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
