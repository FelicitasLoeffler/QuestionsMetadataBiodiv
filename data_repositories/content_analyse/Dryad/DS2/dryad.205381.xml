Description of 238 populations of Potentilla puberula sampled between 1999 and 2015 in the Eastern European Alps. Geographical and collection information, number of sampled individuals (N) and cytotype composition, as well as source of flow cytometric data (FCM) are given. Topographic parameters (elevation, in m a.s.l., inclination and aspect, in degrees), a variable representing the land use intensity, an index of vegetation density (NDVI) and bioclimatic descriptors (Bio01-Bio19, from the Chelsea Climate database) are noted per each population. Please see README for citation information. Soil parameters are reported for 121 populations visited in 2015, including pH, carbonate (CO3--), organic carbon (Corg) and nitrogen content (Ntot, in g/kg), cation exchange capacity (CEC), cations (in mmol/kg), and base saturation (BS, in %).
