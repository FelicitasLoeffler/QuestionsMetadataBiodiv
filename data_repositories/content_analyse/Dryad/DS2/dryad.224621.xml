Individuals were reared at room temperature and ambient lighting conditions. In preparation for the experiment, adults were split into glass dishes and transferred to an incubator at 25C. Full spectrum LED lights were used to simulate diel light (LD). One group of animals were exposed to LD conditions and the second group was maintained in complete darkness (DD) for 30 days. Four (4) replicates from each condition were sampled every 4-hour for a total of 11 time points. Using high throughput sequencing of 16S amplicons representing the bacterial communities associated with N. vectensis, we assayed community composition and membership as well as cycles of differential abundance.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>diel|microbiome|cnidarian|photoperiod</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
