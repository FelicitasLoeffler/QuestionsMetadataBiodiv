Data from other locatities in the Dolomites used as reference are also included. Columns Gc51-a through Gc77-d report simples sequence repeat (SSR) fragment sizes at loci Gc51 (first four columns) and Gc77 (last four columns). Nigritella miniata is a tetraploid species, and all four SSR fragments identified at a locus are usually of different size. Unique combinations of fragments are recognized as genotypes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>agamospermy|Nigritella miniata|Sp statistics|spatial genetic structure</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
