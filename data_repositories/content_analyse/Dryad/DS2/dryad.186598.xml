By using siRNAs to pressure escape mutations, 30 replication-competent HCV genomes having nucleotide changes in the conserved 5&#8242; untranslated region (UTR) were identified. In silico analysis predicted that miR-122 annealing induces canonical HCV genomic 5&#8242; UTR RNA folding, and mutant 5&#8242; UTR sequences that promoted miR-122-independent HCV replication favored the formation of the canonical RNA structure, even in the absence of miR-122. Additionally, some mutant viruses adapted to use the siRNA as a miR-122-mimic. We further demonstrate that small RNAs that anneal with perfect complementarity to the 5&#8242; UTR stabilize and promote HCV genome accumulation. Thus, HCV genome stabilization and life-cycle promotion does not require the specific annealing pattern demonstrated for miR-122 nor 5&#8242; end annealing or 3&#8242; overhanging nucleotides. Replication promotion by perfect-match siRNAs was observed in Ago2 knockout cells revealing that other Ago isoforms can support HCV replication. At last, we present a model for miR-122 promotion of the HCV life cycle in which miRNA annealing to the 5&#8242; UTR, in conjunction with any Ago isoform, modifies the 5&#8242; UTR structure to stabilize the viral genome and promote HCV RNA accumulation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Hepatitis C virus|5' UTR|miR-122 binding sites</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
