It requires as input the species-level liana interaction statistics file "treespstatsrelianas.csv" and the bootstrapped iterations of the key statistics "bootstraplianastats.rds" that are the output of running "bci_speciescalcs.r".  See comments in the code for additional information.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Climbing plants|Host-parasite interactions|Lianas|Modern coexistence theory|Natural enemies|Plant population and community dynamics|Shade-tolerance|Tree species coexistence|Vines</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
