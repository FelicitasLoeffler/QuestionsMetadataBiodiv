This limitation can complicate identification and characterization of genes located within presence/absence variations (PAVs). In this study, we present the draft de novo genome assembly of PHJ89, an Oh43-type inbred line. Using three separate reference genome assemblies (B73, PH207, and PHJ89) that represent the predominant germplasm groups of maize, we generated three separate whole-seedling gene expression profile and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) matrices from a panel of 942 diverse inbred lines. We identified 34,447 (B73), 39,672 (PH207), and 37,436 (PHJ89) transcripts that are not present in the respective reference genome assembly. GWAS was conducted in the 942 inbred panel using both the SNP and expression data values to map sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) resistance. Highlighting the impact of alternative reference genomes in gene discovery, GWAS results for SCMV resistance using expression values as a surrogate measure of PAV resulted in robust detection of the physical location of a known resistance gene when using the B73 reference that contains the gene, but not when using the PH207 reference. This study provides the valuable resource of the Oh43-type PHJ89 genome assembly as well as SNP and expression data for 942 individuals generated using three different reference genomes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
