The Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) is a joint initiative across the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Memorial HealthCare, which maintains comprehensive data obtain from EHRs.  Using the LSDB and the NMEDW, we curated a dataset named as the Lynn Sage Data Set with 5-year distant metastasis (LSDS-5YDM), which includes records on 6726 breast cancer patients including clinical features and distant metastasis. The records span 03/02/1990 to 07/28/2015.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>breast cancer|clinical|metastasis|Decision Support|Bayesian Network|Electronic Health Records|EHR|treatment</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
