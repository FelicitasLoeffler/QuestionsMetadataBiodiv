In each community, species-specific trait and biomass data were taken five times during the year. We collected vegetation data in each permanent plot (24 in total) by clipping the aboveground biomass in April 2004, June 2004, August 2004, October 2004 and March 2005. We measured several plant traits relevant to competitive ability (plant height), nutrient acquisition (&#948;15N), water use efficiency (&#948;13C) and allocation (SLA - specific leaf area, LNC - leaf nitrogen concentration, LDMC and StDMC - leaf and stem dry matter content, respectively).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biodiversity decline|diversity-productivity relationship|functional traits|seasonal dynamics|specific leaf area|grassland management|plant resource-use strategy|water use efficiency</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
