Inthe course of a study on in situ germination of two Tillandsia species in adeciduous forest in Yucatan, Mexico, post-dispersal seed predation rates bythe Yucatan deer mouse (Peromyscus yucatanicus) averaged 90%.Post-dispersal predation was thus more limiting than drought.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Anemochory|seed predation|rodents|desiccation|dry deciduous forest|cenote</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
