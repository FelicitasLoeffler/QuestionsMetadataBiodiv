Canine MMVD is seen in older subjects, suggesting age-related epigenetic dysregulation leading to derangements in valvular cell populations and matrix synthesis or degradation.  We hypothesized that valvular interstitial cells (VICs) undergo disease-relevant changes in miRNA expression.  In primary VIC lines from diseased and control valves, miRNA expression was profiled using RT-qPCR and next generation sequencing.  VICs from diseased valves showed phenotypic changes consistent with myofibroblastic differentiation (vimentinlow+, a-SMAhigh+), increases in senescence markers (p21, SA-b-gal), and decreased cell viability and proliferation potential.  RT-qPCR and miRNA sequencing analyses both showed significant (p&lt;0.05) downregulation of let-7c, miR-17, miR-20a, and miR-30d in VICs from diseased valves compared to controls.  Decreased let-7c, miR-17, and miR-20a may contribute to myofibroblastic differentiation in addition to cell senescence, and decreased miR-30d may disinhibit cell apoptosis.  These data support the hypothesis that epigenetic dysregulation plays an important role in age-related canine MMVD.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
