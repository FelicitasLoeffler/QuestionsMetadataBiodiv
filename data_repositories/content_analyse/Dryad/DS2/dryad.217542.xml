Nestlings were cross-fostered between 2005 and 2009 and thus RearID is their nest of rearing while GeneticID is their nest of origin. Sex is 1 for female, 2 for male and 0 when unknown. Vane tarsus, and wing length are measured in mm and weight_d16 is measured in g. machine refers to the spectrophotometer that was used for measuring tail feathers (1 for 2005-2006, 2 for the other years).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>sexual selection|coloration|good genes|genetic correlation|immune response|heritability|wild|G matrix</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
