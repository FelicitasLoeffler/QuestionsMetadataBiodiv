The data has been collected using a microfluidic device, called the mother machine. The discrete time steps in the Leslie matrix is one hour (note the initial data has been collected at 4 min time intervals). Age goes from birth (second column) to the last column of the matrix. Fertility rates (number of division per hour) are in the top row (first row after the header row). Survival rates are in the sub-diagonal. Final age with open age class.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biodemography|individual heterogeneity|Leslie matrix|aging|senescence|neutral variability|genetic variability</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
