Insect data are organized by week of dung sample collection (column) and taxa of emerged insects (row). Eprinomectin data are similarly organized but rows contain eprinomectin concentrations expressed on dung fresh weight or dry weight basis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>dung breeding insects|eprinomectin|LongRange</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
