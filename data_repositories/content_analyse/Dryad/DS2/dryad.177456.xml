The grey panel lists internal node IDs and subtending terminal taxa. The blue panel are results from ML ancestral state reconstruction. The yellow panel are results from MCMC ancestral state reconstruction. Abbreviations: Ultra 0, ultrametric tree generated with penalty = 0, Ultra 10, ultrametric tree generated with penalty = 10, Ultra 10000, ultrametric tree generated with penalty = 10000.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aposematic colouration|body size|ancestral state reconstruction|phylogenetic logistic regression|phylogenetic ANOVA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
