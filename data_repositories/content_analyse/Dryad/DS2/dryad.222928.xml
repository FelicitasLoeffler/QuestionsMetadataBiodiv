The 'InputMaps_1kmSabah' folder includes probability of occurrence maps for: (1) the 15 endemic butterfly species ('Endemic_15' sub-folder), and (2) the 62 Sundaland-restricted (but non-endemic) butterfly species ('NonEndemic_62' sub-folder) across Sabah. R code for prioritization analyses using the prioritizr package is provided in the 'Prioritization_butterflies.R' R script file.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Insects|Conservation prioritization|Reserve design|Species distribution models|Tropical biodiversity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
