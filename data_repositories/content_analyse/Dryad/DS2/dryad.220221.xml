Indeed, behaviors that reflect an individual's personality can respond to environmental factors or change with age. To date, little is known regarding personality changes during a wild animals' lifetime and even less about stability in heritability of behavior across ages. In this study, we investigated age&#8208;related changes in the mean and in the additive genetic variance of exploratory behavior, a commonly used measure of animal personality, in a wild population of great tits. Heritability of exploration is reduced in adults compared to juveniles, with a low genetic correlation across these age classes. A random regression animal model confirmed the occurrence of genotype&#8211;age interactions (G&#215;A) in exploration, causing a decrease in additive genetic variance before individuals become 1 year old, and a decline in cross&#8208;age genetic correlations between young and increasingly old individuals. Of the few studies investigating G&#215;A in behaviors, this study provides rare evidence for this phenomenon in an extensively studied behavior. We indeed demonstrate that heritability and cross&#8208;age genetic correlations in this behavior are not stable over an individual's lifetime, which can affect its potential response to selection. Because G&#215;A is likely to be common in behaviors and have consequences for our understanding of the evolution of animal personality, more attention should be turned to this phenomenon in the future work.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>genotype-age interaction|heritability|animal model|personality|development|plasticity|exploration</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
