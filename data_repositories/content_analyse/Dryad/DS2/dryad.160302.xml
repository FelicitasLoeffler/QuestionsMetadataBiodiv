All file names indicate the time period ['contemp' = 1980-2000, 'future' = 2080-2100], variables ([survival' = embryo survival (percent decimal) 'growth' = population growth (lizards/year), 'maturity' = age at maturity (days), 'minmaxtemp' = minimum and maximum daily temperatures(&#176;C)], and whether the output is from the 'lethal' or 'sublethal' model as described in the manuscript (or in the case of the age-at-maturity model, whether it includes the effect of slowed juvenile growth).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>sublethal|temperature|embryo|survival|growth|ontogeny|distribution|climate change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
