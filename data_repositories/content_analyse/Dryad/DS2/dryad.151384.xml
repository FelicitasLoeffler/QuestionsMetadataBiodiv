The data contains information regarding species detections (presence/absence) by sites (with each row identifying each of the 5 distinct survey events for each site [data was aggregated by site for richness and compositional analyses]). Data on the level of agricultulral transformation (%_surrouding_naiveness) and the region (Western and Tablelands) are provided both as continuous and factor values.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Agroecosystems|Anthropogenic land-use|Global change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
