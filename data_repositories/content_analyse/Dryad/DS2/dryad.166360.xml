Herein, the structure and oxygen diffusion across the trophoblast membrane between the fetal and maternal red blood cells in the feto-placental vasculature system in both human and mouse placentas are present together as a functional unit. Previous models have claimed that the most efficient fetal blood flow relies upon structures containing a number of &#8216;conductive&#8217; symmetrical branches, offering a path of minimal resistance that maximizes blood flow to the terminal villi, where oxygen diffusion occurs. However, most of these models have disregarded the actual descriptions of the exchange at the level of the intermediate and terminal villi. We are proposing a &#8216;mixed model&#8217; whereby both &#8216;conductive&#8217; and &#8216;terminal&#8217; villi are presumed to be present at the end of single (in human) or multiple (in mouse) pregnancies. We predict an optimal number of 18 and 22 bifurcation levels in the human and the mouse placentas, respectively. Wherever possible, we have compared our model&#8217;s predictions with experimental results reported in the literature and found close agreement between them.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Theoretical modeling|human and mouse placental blood flow|feto-placental vasculature system|mass transport|convective and diffusive resistance</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
