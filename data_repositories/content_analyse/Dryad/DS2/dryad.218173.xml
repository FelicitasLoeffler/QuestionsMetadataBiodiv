In each case, Rhodelphis were shown to be sister to red algae, in the 153/253 dataset, picozoa were shown to be sister to Rhodelphis + red algae. Unlike maximum likelihood analyses, Bayesian analyses recovered the monophyly of Archaeplastida.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>red algae|Archaeplastida|plastid|phylogenomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
