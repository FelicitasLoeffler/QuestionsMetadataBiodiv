The script is extensively annotated using comments. The script will also perform several clustering analyses on the produced genetic data files. For this, the programs Structure, Admixture, and Instruct should be first downloaded from their respective websites, and placed in the R working directory. The package also contains the parameter files that are used for the Structure analysis, these should also be placed in the working directory.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bayesian clustering|polyploidy|Population genetics|Structure|Admixture</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
