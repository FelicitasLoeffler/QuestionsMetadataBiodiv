Similar to the other life cycle file, the simulations are run by holding the frequency of the genetic quality alleles constant. The file allows users to generate a timeseries plot for given values of parameters. The plot provided is the same as that shown in Figure S5 of the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Selection - Sexual|Signaling/Courtship|Models/Simulations|Behavior</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
