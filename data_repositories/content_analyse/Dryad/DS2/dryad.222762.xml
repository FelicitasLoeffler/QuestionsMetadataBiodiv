The single (1 colonist) or many (9 colonists) quantity treatment is denoted under the 'quantity' heading. The 'replicate' heading identifies the individual replicates in each treatment (n=6 for single treatments, n=5 for many treatments, n=5 for the Mixed treatment). The density (individuals per L) values plotted in Figure 1 and used to calculate treatment effect sizes are given in the 'density(ind/L)' column.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>colonization|trait|propagule pressure|sampling effect|genotype identity|extinction</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
