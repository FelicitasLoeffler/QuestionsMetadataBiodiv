Herein, ethanol acts as carbon source, ferrocene and thiophene as catalyst precursor and growth promoter, respectively. By adopting a low feeding rate of 4 &#956;l/min, the fabricated TCFs present one of the lowest sheet resistances of ca. 78 ohm/sq. at 90% transmittance. Optical characterizations demonstrate that the mean diameter of high quality SWCNTs is up to 2 nm. Additionally, electron microcopy observations provide the evidences that the mean length of SWCNT bundles is as long as 28.4 &#956;m while the mean bundle diameter is only 5.3 nm. Moreover, very few CNT loops can be found in the film. Remarkably, the fraction of individual SWCNTs climbs up to 24.6%. All those morphology data account for the superior optoelectronic performance of our SWCNT TCFs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Single-walled carbon nanotubes|transparent conducting films|ethanol|floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
