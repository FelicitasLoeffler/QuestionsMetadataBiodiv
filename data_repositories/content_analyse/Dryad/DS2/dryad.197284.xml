The sighting histories are restricted to calves whose mothers were seen in the three years following birth. The file can be imported into RMark, and then converted to an .inp file to fit mark-recapture models (using MARK software) .</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>capture-recapture|sighting histories|MARK</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
