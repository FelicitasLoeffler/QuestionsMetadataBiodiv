The data were filtered and interpolated at a 10-minute resolution using R, as described in the paper. The data set includes: the bird and trip ID numbers, the longitude and latitude coordinates of a bird at each time step of a trip, the corresponding date and time, the step length (in degrees), the bearing (measured from 0 radians), and the closest boat's longitude, latitude and distance (in km) from the bird.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Animal telemetry|Bayesian|Movement attractors|Central place foraging|Hidden state modelling|Multi-scale</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
