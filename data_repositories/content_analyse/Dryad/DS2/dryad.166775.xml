Australian atracine spiders (family Hexathelidae), including the notorious Sydney funnel-web spider Atrax robustus, produce venom peptides that can kill people. Intriguingly, eastern Australian mouse spiders (family Actinopodidae) are also medically dangerous, possessing venom peptides strikingly similar to Atrax hexatoxins. Based on the standing morphology-based classification, mouse spiders are hypothesized distant relatives of atracines, having diverged over 200 million years ago. Using sequence-capture phylogenomics, we instead show convincingly that atracines are sister to actinopodids, and that hexathelids are non-monophyletic. Three new mygalomorph lineages are elevated to the family level, and a revised circumscription of the family Hexathelidae is presented. Re-writing this phylogenetic story has major implications for how we study venom evolution in these spiders, and potentially genuine consequences for antivenom development and bite treatment research. More generally, our research provides a textbook example of the applied importance of modern phylogenomic research.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>phylogenomics|venom evolution|ultraconserved element|taxonomy</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
