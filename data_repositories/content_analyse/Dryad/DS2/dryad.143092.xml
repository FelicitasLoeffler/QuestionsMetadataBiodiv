The variable PoD denotes locality, followed by year (the last two digits of years spanning 2008 to 2011), and month, each in 2 letter code (see paper for complete locality names, GPS coordinates and descriptions). MosID is the variable containing the mosquito unique identifier, followed by the variables listing the mosquito sex (Sex) and collection date (CollDate). The locus variable is defined by the chromosome arm e.g., '2R' and followed by the unique position of this SNP in the conventional genome sequence of Anopheles gambiae. The genotype of this mosquito at this locus is provided in the variable Geno. Undetermined genotypes are denoted by zeros.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>aestivation|dormancy|effective population size|malaria|migration|Sahel|seasonality|SNPs</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
