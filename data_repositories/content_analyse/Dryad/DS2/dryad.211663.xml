The same process is thought to prevent XY to ZW turnovers, because the latter requires fixation of the ancestral Y, assuming dominance of the emergent feminizing mutation. Using individual-based simulations, we explored whether and how an epistatically dominant W allele can spread in a young XY system that gradually accumulates deleterious mutations. We also investigated how sexually antagonistic (SA) polymorphism on the ancestral sex chromosomes and the mechanism controlling X-Y recombination suppression affect these transitions. In contrast with XY to XY turnovers, XY to ZW turnovers cannot be favored by Y chromosome mutation load. If the arrest of X-Y recombination depends on genotypic sex, transitions are strongly hindered by deleterious mutations, and totally suppressed by very small SA cost, because deleterious mutations and female-detrimental SA alleles would have to fix with the Y. If, however, the arrest of X-Y recombination depends on phenotypic sex, X and Y recombine in XY ZW females, allowing for the purge of Y-linked deleterious mutations and loss of the SA polymorphism, causing XY to ZW turnovers to occur at the same rate as in the absence of deleterious and sex-antagonistic mutations. We generalize our results to other types of turnovers (e.g., triggered by non-dominant sex-determining mutations) and discuss their empirical relevance.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
