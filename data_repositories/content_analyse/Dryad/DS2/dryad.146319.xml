Nexus file containing codon position 1 &amp; 2 for 557 loci and 23 taxa. See taxa_list.txt for species names of each taxon, this is a nucleotide nexus file with a CHARSET that defines each gene that starts with codon position 1. Synonymous signal was removed using degen v1.4 Perl script (http://www.phylotools.com), and the third codon has been removed. Loci names correspond to Loci numbers in the Lep1 enrichment kit included in this DRAYD package. For further information see Breinholt et al. (2017) and Breinholt_et_al_Supplementary_File_1_S1-S11.xlsx in this Dryad package for more details.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>exon|phylogenomics|ultraconserved elements|hybrid enrichment|sequence capture|transcriptomics|target capture</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
