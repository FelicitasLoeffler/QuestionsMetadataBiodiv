(a)	Mean vessel density of endothelial cell clusters, p, with the Std. Error as a function of time.(b)	Mean number of cell clusters, N, with the Std. Error as a function of time.(c)	The average largest cluster density, p^LC, with the Std. Error as a function of time.(d)	The largest cluster density, p^LC for a single embryo as a function of time.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Vasculogenesis|Complex Networks|Antiangiogenic Regulators|Percolation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
