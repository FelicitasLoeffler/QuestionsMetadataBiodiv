To investigate the modes of failure of rock masses surrounding tunnels owing to weak interlayers and groundwater, model tests and numerical simulations were conducted in this study based on two cases, and a model that considers only the weak interlayer was conducted for comparison. Based on the tests, differences between two models in terms of rock pressure, displacement, cracks and strain were analysed. The results reveal that the presence of groundwater has a significant effect on the space&#8211;time distribution of stress, displacement and cracks in the surrounding rock. Furthermore, based on the numerical model, the seepage field was analysed in terms of pore water pressure, permeability and the seepage process to understand the joint action of groundwater and weak interlayer on the failure mechanism of tunnels. The results show that the groundwater and interlayer complement each other to induce the failure mode of the surrounding rock. The water accelerates slip in the interlayer and the development of cracks. Conversely, low-strength, muddy weak interlayer serve as the channels of water flow, resulting in deformations and cracks at different locations and different failure modes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>tunnel engineering|model test|seepage and weak interlayer|failure modes|failure mechanism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
