Each profile includes soil class and horizon designations, and some of the data required for soil carbon stock calculations (e.g. bulk density, carbon concentration, horizon depth and coarse fragment content). Missing data which were gap-filled are highlighted and annotated with comments, and were filled according to procedures outlined in the manuscript and supplement. Data formatting across the different sources were harmonized where possible. References, acknowledgements and field descriptors are provided, including comments on calculation steps. More detail is available in the manuscript supplement.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>soil carbon|random forest|temperate rainforest|pedology|machine learning</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
