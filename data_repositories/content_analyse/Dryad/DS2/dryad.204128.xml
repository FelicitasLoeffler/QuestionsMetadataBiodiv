Basal area was calculated from dbh. Data was recorded May 27&#8211;June 5. Each tube was visited, each seedling was identified and marked with a colored pin, and seedling length was measured with a ruler to the nearest 0.1 cm. Each tube was checked for burning. Thatch level was visually recorded into categories by percent cover (and depth for level 4).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>establishment limitation|land-use legacies|longleaf pine savanna|plant life stage|root competition|dispersal limitation|canopy thinning|belowground competition|land-use history</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
