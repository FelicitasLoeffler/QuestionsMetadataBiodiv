RADseq genotypes were mapped the a genome draft. For each SNP (defined by the position along the genomic contig where it was mapped) and genomic comparison between two parapatric populations we show the identity and read counts for the major allele (maa) in the two populations (ie.. pop1 is the dune population and pop2 is the headland population). We also show the value of Fst, as calculated by Popoolation2, as well as the p-value of a fisher exact test of allelic differentiation (FET). Finally, in the last column we show if the SNPs had outlier Fst values (i.e. upper 5% tail of the distribution) and presented significantly different allelic frequencies in the FET (Bonferroni corrected p-value lower than 5%).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Supergenes|Adaptation|Parallel Evolution|Ecotypes|QTL mapping|Transplant experiment</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
