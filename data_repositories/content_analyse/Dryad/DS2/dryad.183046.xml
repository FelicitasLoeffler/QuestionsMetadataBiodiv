The data are hand-written on data paper as the original data were taken.  Note that the Greek letter lambda refers to the capacity of the Drummond microcap used to extract nectar, e.g., 5 lambda = 5 ul capacity.  Each microcap capacity has a fixed length (1, 2, and 5 = 32mm long, 10 = 41mm), this is essential to know in converting mm of nectar to microliters of nectar.  Sites referred to on the data sheets are explained in Table 1 of the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Behavior|Energetics|Foraging|Interactions: plant/animal|Bird</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
