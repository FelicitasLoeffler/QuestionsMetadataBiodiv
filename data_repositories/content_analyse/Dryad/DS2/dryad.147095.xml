A matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) antibody array and quantitative RT-PCR revealed upregulation of MMP2 post-transcriptionally in human first trimester HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast cells and placental villous explants exposed to 2% O2. Specific MMP inhibitors established the requirement for MMP2 in HBEGF shedding and upregulation. Because &#945;-amanitin inhibited the upregulation of HBEGF, differentially expressed genes were identified by next-generation sequencing of RNA from trophoblast cells cultured at 2% O2 for 0, 1, 2 and 4&#8201;h. Nine genes, all containing HIF-response elements, were upregulated at 1&#8201;h, but only HSPA6 (HSP70B&#8217;) remained elevated at 2&#8211;4&#8201;h. The HSP70 chaperone inhibitor VER 155008 blocked upregulation of both MMP2 and HBEGF at 2% O2, and increased apoptosis. However, both HBEGF upregulation and apoptosis were rescued by exogenous MMP2. Proximity ligation assays demonstrated interactions between HSP70 and MMP2, and between MMP2 and HBEGF, supporting the concept that MMP2-mediated shedding of HBEGF, initiated by HSP70, contributes to trophoblast survival at the low O2 concentrations encountered during the first trimester, and is essential for successful pregnancy outcomes. Trophoblast survival during human placentation, when oxygenation is minimal, required HSP70 activity, which mediated MMP2 accumulation and the transactivation of anti-apoptotic ERBB signaling by HBEGF shedding.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
