In arid to semi-arid regions of the world it is a key component of biological soil crusts, which are fundamental to healthy dryland ecosystem processes. As such, S. ruralis has attracted the attention of conservationists seeking to restore degraded biological soil crust communities and their associated vascular flora. Here, we generate genomic data for S. ruralis populations that span climatic gradients across the Colorado Plateau of the southwestern USA to investigate the contributions of neutral and deterministic processes to the partitioning of genomic structure. Although S. ruralis appears to be highly dispersible, geographic proximity significantly predicts genomic similarity. In addition, even when taking into account apparently high migration rates among populations and spatial autocorrelation of allele frequencies, some genomic variation is explained by environmental gradients correlated with elevation and latitude. Consequently, efforts to restore dryland ecosystems by establishing S. ruralis as a foundation should include strategies to ensure that propagule sources of this moss are environmentally stratified and targeted to the current/future climates of restoration sites.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>phylogeography|bryophyte|next-generation sequencing|RADseq|Procrustes|biological soil crust|biocrust</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
