These data were used to create the figures in the associated manuscript, and highlight which sensors have been used to measure specific patterns. These figures do not to provide a comprehensive review of all patterns measured by each sensor, in each case, the most cited or most novel studies were selected.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biodiversity monitoring|Earth observations|pattern|scale|spatial ecology|biogeography|modeling</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
