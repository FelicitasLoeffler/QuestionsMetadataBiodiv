The first tier has two steps (step 1: refugial scenarios, step 2: distributional shift scenarios). Tier 2 only has one step, but the winning scenarios from tier 1 are compared including or excluding a third scenario, vicariance. For the former (including vicariance), we computed type I and II error rates for all three scenarios, rather than just the winning scenario.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>approximate Bayesian computation|demographic history|evolutionary history|phylogeography|postglacial expansion|species distribution modeling</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
