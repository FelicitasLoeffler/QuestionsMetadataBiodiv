These were aligned with 2b/1b hemigenomes, representing the 1b portion of the coding region separated at the Recombination Detection Program (RDP)-inferred breakpoint, using the fast option in MAFFT version 7 in AliView and edited manually. Recombinant genomes were acquired from this study or these databases.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>phylogeography|circulating recombinant form|hepatitis C virus</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
