Fluxes are calculated as daily means and curated for QA/QC as described in the journal article. Measurement dates comprise from September 2014 to September 2015. Values as -9999 represent missing values due to QA/QC or instrument failure.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>soil CO2 efflux|soil CH4 fluxes|soil N2O fluxes|automated measurements|soil respiration</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
