The brain specimen was donated by a 58-year-old woman who had no history of neurological disease and died of non-neurological causes. Her family provided written informed consent. We imaged her brain for 5 days continuously on a 7 Tesla MRI scanner using a custom-built 31-channel receive array coil. The images shown here are from the acquired FA25 volume.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>mri|brain|anatomy|neuroanatomy</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
