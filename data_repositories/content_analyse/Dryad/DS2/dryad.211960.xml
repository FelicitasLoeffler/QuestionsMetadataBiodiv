Competition treatments are labeled by the number of sea stars held in a tank, and of what species. Evasterias is abbreviated with &#8220;Eva&#8221; and Pisaster is abbreviated with &#8220;Pi&#8221;. The interspecific treatment for Evasterias response was &#8220;Eva (2 Eva + 2 Pi)&#8221; and for Pisaster response was &#8220;Pi (2 Eva + 2 Pi)&#8221;. Each treatment was replicated three times per experiment (denoted as &#8220;tank&#8221; number), with the exception of experiment three, where the interspecific treatment was replicated four times, for a total of 9 replications and 10 replications respectively across all three experiments. Sample size varied per treatment as some sea stars developed signs of SSWD and thus were removed and replaced with uninfected sea stars. Replacement sea star weights were not included in the data set or growth analysis. For more details on the methods see supplement section S1.3.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>disease outbreak|asteroid idiopathic wasting syndrome|diet|competition|population size|susceptibility</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
