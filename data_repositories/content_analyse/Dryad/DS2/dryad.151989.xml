To design new cinnamaldehyde amino acid Schiff base compounds with high bioactivity, the quantitative structure&#8211;activity relationships (QSARs) for CAAS compounds against Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and Penicillium citrinum (P. citrinum) were analysed. The QSAR models (R2&#8201;=&#8201;0.9346 for A. niger, R2&#8201;=&#8201;0.9590 for P. citrinum,) were constructed and validated. The models indicated that the molecular polarity and the Max atomic orbital electronic population had a significant effect on antifungal activity. Based on the best QSAR models, two new compounds were designed and synthesized. Antifungal activity tests proved that both of them have great bioactivity against the selected fungi.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cinnamaldehyde|Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR)|Schiff base|antifungal activity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
