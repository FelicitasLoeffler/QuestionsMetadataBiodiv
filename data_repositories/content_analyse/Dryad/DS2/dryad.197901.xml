Data is presented in the format used by JoinMap 4.1 in which &lt;nnxnp&gt; represent loci in which the father is homozygote and the F1 mother is heterozygote and &lt;hkxhk&gt; represent loci in which both parents are heterozygotes. Tab 2: Same data in raw SNP format including mother (F1) and father (G. pennsylvanicus) information.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Mapping family|Backcross offspring</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
