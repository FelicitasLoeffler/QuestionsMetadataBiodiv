Within the primarily South American spider subfamily Amaurobioidinae (Anyphaenidae), several species are found living in the continent&#8217;s grasslands, with some displaying putative morphological adaptations to dwelling unnoticed in the grass blades. Here, a dated molecular phylogeny provides the backbone for analyses revealing the ecological and morphological processes behind these spiders&#8217; grassland adaptations. The multiple switches from Patagonian forests to open habitats coincide with the expansion of South America&#8217;s grasslands during the Miocene, while the specialized morphology of several grass-dwelling spiders originated at least three independent times and is best described as the result of different selective regimes operating on macroevolutionary timescales. Although grass-adapted lineages evolved towards different peaks in adaptive landscape, they all share one characteristic: an anterior narrowing of the prosoma allowing spiders to extend the first two pairs of legs, thus maintaining a slender resting posture in the grass blade. By combining phylogenetic, morphological, and biogeographic perspectives we disentangle multiple factors determining the evolution of a clade of terrestrial invertebrate predators alongside their biomes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biogeography|Morphometrics|Macroevolution|Anyphaenidae|Amaurobioidinae</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
