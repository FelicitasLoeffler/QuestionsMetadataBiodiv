Two letter codes and population names are provided and match codes and names used in genetic data and the accompanying manuscript. For analyses in this manuscript, sample locations were not considered below the population level. File includes projection information and all subfiles are contained in a windows zip file that would need to be extracted for use in ArcMap. Created in ArcMap version 10.2.2.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Conservation Genetics|Wildlife Management|Mammals|Landscape Genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
