Counts were made by eye, looking down a microscope.w1 - the volume of liquid in ml removed from the community for sampling abundance, used to calculate density per ml.w2 - the volume of diluent added to the volume sampled.w3 - the volume of the sub-sample taken of the mixture of diluent and sample removed (i.e. w1 + w2).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
