This fact can be exploited to develop efficient pest control strategies that use Y-linked editors to disrupt the fitness of female descendants. With simple population genetic and dynamic models we show that Y-linked editors can be substantially more efficient than other self-limiting strategies and, while not as efficient as gene drive approaches, are expected to have less impact on non-target populations with which there is some gene flow. Efficiency can be further augmented by simultaneously releasing an autosomal X-shredder construct, in either the same or different males. Y-linked editors may be attractive option to consider when efficient control of a species is desired in some locales but not others.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Pest control|Sterile insect technique|Gene drive|Gene editing|CRISPR|Computer code (Mathematica file)</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
