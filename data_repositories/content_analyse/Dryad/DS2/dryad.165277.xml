See Electronic Supplementary Material text S1 and table S1 for institutional abbreviations and metric variables. "FAM" = F:AM. Sample abbreviations: NTC, Natural Trap Cave, RLB, Rancho La Brea gray wolves. All specimens represent the gray wolf (Canis lupus) except for those listed as Canis dirus. Years in brackets are probable years of collection. Subspecific identity of USNM A3497 is not recorded in USNM database, but we tentatively consider it to represent C. l. nubilus based on its locality and measurements. USNM A977 is reported as C. l. nubilus in the database, but its subspecific identification is questionable (see main text).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>postcrania</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
