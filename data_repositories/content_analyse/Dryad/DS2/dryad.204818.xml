The tribe comprises two small Malesian genera, Parartocarpus and Hullettia, and brings the total number of Moraceae tribes to seven. Evidence for this new designation comes from a phylogeny based on 333 nuclear genes sequenced using target enrichment via hybridization (hybseq). Morphological characters that set Parartocarpeae apart from other Moraceae tribes include the combination of the following characters: lateral nonamplexicaul stipules, spirally arranged leaves without annulate stipule scars, the presence of a single layer of involucral inflorescence bracts, and the lack of perianth tissue, wherein flowers are embedded in cavities of the receptacle. With the designation of Parartocarpeae, the tribe-level circumscription of Moraceae is now well-supported by phylogenetic methods. Because the phylogenetic markers employed here work well throughout Moraceae, they can facilitate much needed work at the genus level in the family.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>hybridization sequencing|Hullettia|inflexed stamens|Malesia|Parartocarpus</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
