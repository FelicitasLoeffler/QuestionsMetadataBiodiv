The OTU table in sheet 1 includes negatives and repetitions, and samples (in columns) are tagged by their PCR IDs (see mapping file). The OTU table in sheet 2 does not include negatives and repetitions, OTUs are annotated according to database matches, and samples (in rows) are categorized according to treatment and other design variables (see Jacobsen et al. 2018). Sheet 2 lists the information extracted for the annotated taxa of each OTU from the database FUNGUILD (see Jacobsen et al. 2018).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Top-down|saproxylic|insects|decomposition|dead wood|community assembly|high-throughput sequencing|DNA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
