This set of files is the same as the CSV files, except that they formatted for use with MimicrEE simulation software. Also, we provide  &#8220;Dsim_recombination_map_LOESS_100kb_1.txt&#8221;, in which LOESS smoothing equivalent to 100 kb windows is applied through an alternative R algorithm. The standard files provided are, again, the moving median and LOESS smoothed maps. For Dsim, moving median files are provided at resolutions: 5, 25, 101, 501, and 2501 kb. For Dmel, the moving median files are provided at resolutions: 501, and 2501 kb, due to a lower resolution initial map. For Dsim the LOESS files are at 0.001, 0.005, 0.02, 0.10. These levels are equivalent to moving median windows of 25, 101, 501, and 2501 kb. For Dmel, the LOESS smoothing parameter is set at: 0.02, 0.10. A raw recombination map is provided for Dsim, in 1 kb windows and for Dmel in 101 kb windows. Details for how this raw map was produced can be found in our paper, Howie et et al. 2019. The R script used to produce differently smoothed recombination maps is provided as an R-Markdown file.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Recombination Maps|Motif Density Files|Phased Haplotypes for Recombination Maps</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
