The file includes genotype scores for eight microsatellite loci for Blueface (cfzon) and Bandfin (zon) darters. Locus names are listed under the title line at the top of the file. POP refers to populations described in the manuscript. The populations are ordered as follows: (Blueface Darter) 1. Little Bear Creek, 2. Turkey Creek, 3. Bear Creek, 4. Hubbard Cr. above falls, 5. Hubbard Cr. below falls, (Bandfin Darter) 6. Bear Creek, 7. Big Sandy River, 8. Birdsong Creek, and 9. Hatchie River. Each row below POP identifiers represents an individual followed by their genotype for the eight loci. Individual identifiers and specimen information can be found in the associated excel file named "Blueface_Bandfin_specimen_info.xlsx". Allele scores for each locus are concatenated into six digits, with the first three numbers representing the size of allele "one" and the second three numbers representing the size of allele "two". Missing data are coded as "000".</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>conservation genetics|microsatellites|mtDNA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
