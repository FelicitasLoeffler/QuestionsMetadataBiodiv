Integrating thermal physiology within a syndrome Funct.Ecology</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This data file contain 4 tabs: The first tab contains data for the thermal characteristics (e.g Vmax) for each individual analysed in the corresponding paper. The second tab contains the behavioural data (e.g. activity) for each individual analysed in the corresponding paper. The third tab contains the raw habitat use data. This data contains information regarding each individuals microhabitat use on each day of their trial period, and also the total of proportion of time each individual spent in each microhabitat over the entire 3-day period. Finally, the fourth tab contains the ibutton data which are the temperature recordings taken in each microhabitat over the entire experimental period. Note - we have not provided the raw thermal characteristics data (i.e. the data involved in calculating the thermal variables).
