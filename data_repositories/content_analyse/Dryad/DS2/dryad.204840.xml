Visitors were registered for one visit whenever they entered the observed area and visited the first flower, and not counted again while they stayed on the patch, regardless of the number of flowers visited. As hummingbirds avoid approaching human observers too closely but visited flowers at ca. 2 m distance from the observers, a hummingbird visit was scored for every time the bird foraged in the perimeter of the patch. Visitor behaviour was classified as &#8220;using the flowers as intended&#8221;, i.e. entering the corolla orifice to probe for nectar, &#8220;pollen thief&#8221;, i.e. emptying the anthers without touching the stigma, or &#8220;nectar thief&#8221;, i.e. piercing the corolla base or using holes made by other such thieves. In the first case, it was noted whether the visitor would actually touch the reproductive organs, in which case they were considered a pollinator. If a pollinator showed two different types of behaviour, both were recorded and the predominant behaviour was noted as such, but no percentages were recorded.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>pollination</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
