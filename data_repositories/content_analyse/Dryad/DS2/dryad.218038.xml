The dataset showed a significant increasing trend of EHEs before 2000, while a slight post&#8208;2000 decline. Correspondingly, the EHEs&#8208;caused economic losses increased obviously before 2000 followed by a slight decrease, the post&#8208;2000 decline could be partially attributed to the decreases in drought and flood&#8208;prone area, or climate adaptation practices. Spatially, Asia experienced most EHEs (969), corresponding to the largest share of economic losses (approximately $868 billion for floods and $50 billion for droughts, respectively), while Oceania had the least EHEs (102) and the least economic losses (approximately $19 billion for floods and $45 billion for droughts). The five countries with the highest EHE&#8208;caused economic losses were China, USA, Canada, Australia, and India. Countries that suffered the highest flood&#8208;caused economic losses were China, USA, and Canada. This dataset provides a quantitative linkage between climate science and economic losses at a global scale, and it is beneficial for the regional climatic impact assessments and strategical development for mitigating climate change impacts.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Droughts|Extreme Hydrological Events|Floods|Economic losses|Climate change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
