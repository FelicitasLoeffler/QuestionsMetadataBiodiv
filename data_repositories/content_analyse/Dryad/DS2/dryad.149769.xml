'Parent' column represents the source of the interaction. 'Child' column represents the target of the interaction. 'Sign' represents the effect of the Parent species on the Child species. Since feeding interactions are +/-, each predator-prey pair will be represented by two rows: one for the negative effect of predator on prey, and one for the positive effect of prey on predator.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>presence-absence|food web|interaction web|Dynamic Bayesian networks|LASSO regression|network inference</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
