Hence, only processed data reduced to the minimum columns necessary to run the analyses performed in De Solan et al, 2019 are provided. Raw data can be applied for to Jean-Yves Barnagaud (jean-yves.barnagaud@cefe.cnrs.fr) at the Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive, 1919 route de Mende, 34090 Montpellier, Fr. ## Files description:  # Folder scripts:  script_regional_scale.R: prepares data and runs the ppm at the regional scalescript_local_scale.R: prepares data and runs the ppm at the local scaleScript_traits_analysis.R: performs the analysis of traits against ppm coefficientsScript_phylogenetic_analysis.R: checks for a phylogenetic signal in ppm coefficients and traits# Folder phylogenetic_tree:  contains the phylogenetic tree of the considered species. -&gt; tree_timing_3.NWKDescription: phylogenetic tree in the Newick format.Note: The tree was computed by Pierre-Andr&#233; Crochet and a full description is provided in the supplementary materials of De Solan et al, Ecography 2019.
