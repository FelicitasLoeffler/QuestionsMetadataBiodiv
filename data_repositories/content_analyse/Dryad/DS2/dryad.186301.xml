See the original publication for full details. The raw sequencing data is also available from the European Nucleotide Archive. Note that this file will contain abundant errors in comparison to a consensus base call from high coverage data.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>haploidised fasta sequences</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
