Species trees were made from either all 253 single-gene trees from the 151/253 dataset, or b, the 50 trees with the highest relative tree certainty. The sister relationship of Rhodelphis and red algae is recovered with both datasets, and is in agreement with concatenated phylogenomic analyses. The resulting coalescent trees for each dataset, along with the gene trees used to generate the species tree, are included.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>red algae|Archaeplastida|plastid|phylogenomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
