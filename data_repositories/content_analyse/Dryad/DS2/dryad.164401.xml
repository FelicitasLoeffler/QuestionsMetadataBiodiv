These data are contained in Dataset 5, as six individual .fasta text files, including both nucleotide sequence assembly files and amino acid sequence assembly files (translated using TransDecoder) for each of the three tissue types (skin, liver and spleen) [Data Citation 1]. Descriptions of the sequence identifier lines are contained in the associated readme file.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>gene expression|survival|metabolomics|frog|alpine tree frog|chytridiomycosis|disease|fungus|transcriptomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
