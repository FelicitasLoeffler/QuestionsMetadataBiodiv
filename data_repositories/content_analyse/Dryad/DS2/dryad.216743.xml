Projections were done according to five general circulation models (CCSM4, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC 5, MRI-CGCM and NorESM), representative concentration pathway 8.5 and the year 2080. Furthermore, we applied three vertical dispersal scenarios (range contraction, range expansion and range shift). Given are absolute and standardized values (absolute value of a community/ absolute value of the full species pool). For details on the projections, please read the methods in the published article associated with this data set.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biotic interactions|climate change|ecological communities|functional correspondence|global change|seed dispersal|trait matching|trophic interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
