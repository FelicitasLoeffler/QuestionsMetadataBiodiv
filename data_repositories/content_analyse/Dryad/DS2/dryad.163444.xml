Columns included are experimental block number, focal male (sperm donor) ID, focal female (egg chemoattractant donor) ID, replicate (two for each focal male-female cross), focal male fertilization success, focal male failures (eggs not fertilized), and total eggs counted. Sheet 2 contains similar data, but with the two replicate fertilization success measures for each focal male-female cross combined into a single measure. This sheet also contains estimates of nuclear genetic relatedness of male-female pairs, and a column specifying whether males and females belong to different (0) or the same (1) phylogenetic mitochondrial lineage.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Sexual selection|Behaviour|Reproductive strategies</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
