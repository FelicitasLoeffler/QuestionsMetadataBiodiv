Structural MR images were segmented into normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and WMHs, for which a perilesional zone was defined. In these regions, we investigated the BBB permeability, CBF, and their relation using Pearson correlation r.Results: We found a decrease in CBF of 2.2 mL/min/100g(p&lt;0.01) and an increase in leakage volume of 0.7%(p&lt;0.01) per mm closer to the WMHs in the perilesional zones. Lower CBF values correlated with higher leakage measures in the NAWM and WMHs (-0.53&lt;r&lt;-0.40, p&lt;0.05). This relation was also observed in the perilesional zones, which became stronger in the proximity of WMHs (p=0.03).Conclusion: BBB impairment and hypoperfusion appear in the WMHs and NAWM, which increase in the proximity of the WMHs, and are linked. Both BBB and CBF are regulated in the neurovascular unit (NVU) and the observed link might be due to the physiologic regulation mechanism of the NVU. This link may suggest an early overall deterioration of this unit.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cerebrovascular disease/Stroke|MRI|blood-brain barrier impairment|hypoperfusion|neurovascular unit</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
