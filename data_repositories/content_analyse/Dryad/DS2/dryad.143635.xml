Wood density values were estimated taking into account the oven dry mass (g) divided by fresh volume (cm3) of samples derived from three classes of diameter (1-5 cm = twigs, 5-10 cm = branches, &gt; 10 cm = main stem).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biomass|Carbon|Wood density</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
