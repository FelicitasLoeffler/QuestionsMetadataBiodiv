This approach rests on using appropriate model systems, and only few are known to be available. In this paper, we show that Artemia has multiple attractive features (short generation time, cyst bank and collections, well documented phylogeography and ecology) for a good RE model. We show in detail with a case study how cysts can be recovered from sediments to document the history and dynamics of a biological invasion. We finally discuss with precise examples the many RE possibilities with this model system: adaptation to climate change, to pollution, to parasites, to invaders and evolution of reproductive systems.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Sediment Core|Long-term Adaptation|Cysts|Biological Invasions|Global Change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
