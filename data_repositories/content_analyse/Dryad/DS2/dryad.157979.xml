Although certain sub-disciplines of biology have pioneered efforts to ensure their long-term preservation and facilitate collaborations, data continue to disappear, owing mostly to technological, regulatory and ideological hurdles. In this review, we describe the important steps towards proper data management and archiving, and provide a critical discussion on the importance of long term data conservation. We then illustrate the rise in data archiving through the Joint Data Archiving Policy and the Dryad Digital Repository. In particular, we discuss data integration and how the limited availability of large scale datasets can hinder new discoveries. Finally, we propose solutions to increase the rate of data preservation. For example, by generating mechanisms insuring proper data management and archiving, by providing training in data management, and by transforming the traditional role of research institutions and libraries as data generators towards managers and archivers.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
