The latter is taken as a proxy of the degree of polymorphism of each species. British species in the families Geometridae and Noctuidae are included, where a COX1 sequence on BOLD and data as to the number of named intraspecific forms was available. Data includes COX1 sequences used in tree construction and BOLD Id of sequence.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Birds|Lepidoptera|Crypsis|Abundance|Predation|Polymorphism|Apostatic selection|Colouration|Search image</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
