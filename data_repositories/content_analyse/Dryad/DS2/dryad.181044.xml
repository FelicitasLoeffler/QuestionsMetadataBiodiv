During the development of a high-acid gas field, the petroleum pipe is subjected to many aspects of corrosion, and the corrosion mechanism is complicated by the condition of the coexistence of H2S/CO2/O2. Based on the study of the corrosion problem associated with the formate packer fluid in Southwest China, three kinds of steels were studied for corrosion prevention in the Alloy G3/N80 Steel/TP110SS Steel. The study shows that the corrosion rate of the formate packer fluid is low, but corrosion is severe in environments characterised by high temperatures, high pressures and high acid gas contents. Based on the consideration of cost and the difficulty of realization, an anti-corrosion system was constructed based on the existing packer fluid, mainly through the introduction of a variety of anti-corrosion additives. Through the selection of various additives and corrosion experiments, a corrosion protection system of formate packer fluid was developed. Corrosion tests show that the corrosion rate of the system must be less than 0.076 mm/a to achieve the purpose of corrosion protection. The formate packer fluid with corrosion protection can meet the needs of the current application.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Corrosion|High Acid Gas|Formate Packer Fluid|H2S/CO2|Alloy G3/N80 Steel/TP110SS Steel</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
