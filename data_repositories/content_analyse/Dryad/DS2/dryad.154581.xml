Humans have doubled the amount of global reactive nitrogen (N), increasing deposition ofN onto forests worldwide. However, other global changes&#8212;especially climate change and elevatedatmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations&#8212;are increasing demand for N, the element limiting primaryproductivity in temperate forests, which could be reducing N availability. To determine the long-term,integrated effects of global changes on forest N cycling, we measured stable N isotopes in wood, aproxy for N supply relative to demand, on large spatial and temporal scales across the continental U.S.A.Here, we show that forest N availability has generally declined across much of the U.S. since at least1850 C.E. with cool, wet forests demonstrating the greatest declines. Across sites, recent trajectoriesof N availability were independent of recent atmospheric N deposition rates, implying a minor role formodern N deposition on the trajectory of N status of North American forests. Our results demonstratethat current trends of global changes are likely to be consistent with forest oligotrophication into theforeseeable future, further constraining forest C fixation and potentially storage.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>nitrogen|isotopes|forests</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
