The evolutionary history of the character states for the 'stem' and 'tendril' characters were reconstructed using parsimony and maximum likelihood by Mesquite.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptive radiation|biogeography|dispersal|divergence times|diversification|growth habit|key innovation|succulence</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
