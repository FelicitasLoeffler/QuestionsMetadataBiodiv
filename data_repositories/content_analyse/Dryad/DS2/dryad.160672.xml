Each line corresponds to an Ovenbird nest. The number of exposure days was used to calculate the daily survival rate of nests. Mean chipmunk detections corresponds to the mean number of visual or aural detections recorded in each plot and year (6 surveys per plot per year). Mean seedling density indicates the mean density of newly-emerged sugar maple seedlings (with cotyledons) counted in fifty 250 cm^2 quadrats in each plot and year. Treatment refers to selection harvesting (30-40% basal area removal) conducted in two of the four plots during the winter of 2006-2007.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Eastern deciduous forest|Food web|Indirect effects|Migratory songbirds|Nest predation|Resource pulse</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
