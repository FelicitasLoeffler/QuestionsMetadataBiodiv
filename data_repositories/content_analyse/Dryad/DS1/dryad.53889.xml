Each figure shows the original Maxent model outputs in the left column, and the reclassification of that model to the right. The far right images are the final reclassified overlap analysis of the forward projected model and the original model of the next consecutive time slice. Model output values range from 0.0 to 1.0 and indicate probability. Final overlap calculation values indicate agreement, and range from 1 to 4. See Supplemental Appendix 2 for explanation of symbology.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biogeography|Maxent|Competition|Invasion|Climate Change|Ordovician|Paleoecology|Cincinnatian|Katian|Species distribution model|Ecological niche model</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
