Those markers were amplified for 42 species collected in natural populations in the South-African fynbos, except for two external groups which were collected in the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden. A detailed map of the alignment is given below: Positions 1 - 428 : PPR_like marker which contains an exon of 233bp and a 3'-UTR of 195bp. Positions 429 - 1182 : SVR7 marker which contains an exon of 652bp and a 3'-UTR of 102bp. Positions 1183 - 1563 : CAF1-6 marker which only contains an exon of 381bp. Positions 1564 - 2177 : the classical ITS marker. Positions 2178 - 2973 : ATINT1 marker which contains an exon of 665bp and a 3'-UTR of 131bp. Positions 2974 - 3250 : APO2 marker which contains only an exon of 277bp. Positions 3251 - 3908 : ATPHAN marker which contains only an exon of 658bp. Positions 3909 - 4247 : APG6 marker which contains only an exon of 339bp</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>RNA-seq|Non-models groups|3'-UTR|orthology|phylogenetic markers</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
