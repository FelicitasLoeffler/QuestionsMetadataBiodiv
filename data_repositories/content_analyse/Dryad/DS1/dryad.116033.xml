Six clusters were found based on k-medoid clustering on the standard spectral density profiles of all strains (P &lt; 0.05). The distribution across those clusters for strains sampled from 25 countries are shown for avian (a) and human (b) hosts. Four clusters were found using the normalized profiles (P &lt; 0.05) and the distributions are shown for each country for avian (c) and human (d) hosts. Only countries with all seven strains sampled are represented.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biodiversity|diversification|graph theory|laplacian|macroevolution|phylodynamics|phylogenetics|influenza</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
