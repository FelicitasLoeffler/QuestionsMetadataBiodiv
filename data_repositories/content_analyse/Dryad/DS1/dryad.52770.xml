From the 299 bp mitochondrial consensus sequence (bp position 15545-15843 in the mtDNA genome of B. e. edeni [ACCN: AB201258]), H01-H45 were identified as B. e. brydei, and H46-H48 were identified as B. e. edeni. The B. e. edeni haplotype H49 was identified from the 407 bp consensus sequence (bp position 15500-15906 in the mtDNA genome of B. e. edeni [ACCN: AB201258]). The total number of individuals (N) for each haplotype is shown and, when two accession numbers are listed, the number of individuals represented by each is indicated in parentheses. * indicates the five new haplotypes described by the current study. The remaining forty-four haplotypes have been previously described and published (Kanda et al. 2007, Yoshida &amp; Kato 1999). For details of haplotype frequencies across sampling locations, see Figure 2 of the main article.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bryde's whale|population structure|Indo-Pacific|conservation|management|Conservation genetics and biodiversity|phylogeography</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
