The analysis and interpretation of the satellite                imagery was conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up                to 18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for                'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a                spatially-broad perspective. Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below)                correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states. Thus, the                reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-State level. The                statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region. Important Caution                Advisory With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to                see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the dataset for                larger-scale or local analyses. This evaluation must be made remembering that the                NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s. The New Hampshire portion of the NLCD                was created as part of land cover mapping activities for Federal Region I that                includes the States of Connecticut, Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and                Massachusetts. The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover categories                with a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The NLCD was produced as a cooperative                effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental                Protection Agency (USEPA) to produce a consistent, land cover data layer for the                conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by                the Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is                a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data. Partners                include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources                Divisions), USEPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric                Administration. The original NLCD grid was projected into UTM Zone 19 and was                clipped to a box surrounding the USDA Forest Service, Hubbard Brook Experimental                Forest.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>land use|land cover|US Forest Service|landsat|imagery|remote sensing|forest|vegetation|Hubbard Brook|New Hampshire</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
