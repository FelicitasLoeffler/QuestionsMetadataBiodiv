The percent of anhydrobiotic (coiled) nematodes with relation to season was determined.    The study took place on three separate dates during the 1997-1998 austral summer: 21 November 1997, 16 December 1997, and 13 January 1998.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Antarctica|LTER|electrical conductivity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
