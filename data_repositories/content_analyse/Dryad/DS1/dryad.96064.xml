The file was later treated for specific statistics and compared with simulated trees, as described in out methodology. For that the &#8220;processing_treebase.R&#8221; R-script was used, being the file &#8220;treebaselist_output.RData&#8221; the final output. We would like to stress that this is not a complete catalogue of all R-scripts used in our study, especially regarding plotting and investigation of model behavior, once much was simulated with a cluster computer involving multiple outputs, code files and csv parameter tables that changed over time. If you plan to run similar experiments, we strongly encourage the reading of our TreeSimGM R-package help material.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Macroevolution|Diversification|Stochastic models|Birth-death process|Simulated trees|R package TreeSimGM|Empirical trees</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
