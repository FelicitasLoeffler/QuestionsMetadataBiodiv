One would predict, therefore, that the capacity for environmental adjustment by Kestrels is high. This dissertation, in part, attempts to understand better the nature of Kestrel adaptation and adjustment to the environment. The study describes, discusses, and compares in different habitats the natural history of Kestrels during their breeding season in the Sierra of California. Because Kestrels inhabited two different adjacent ecosystems inthe area of study, a comparative approach may facilitate an understanding of Kestrel biology.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Sagehen|American Kestrel</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
