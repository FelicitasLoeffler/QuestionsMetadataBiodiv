Vertical CTD profiles were collected at approximately 2km intervals from 0km to 36km during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure and optical backscatter were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected on the upcast were deleted, and the remaining data were averaged within 0.5m depth bins and interpolated to produce a smooth profile for contouring. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|GCE|LTER|conductivity|density|depth|estuaries|hydrography|pressure|salinity|temperature|water column|Inorganic Nutrients</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
