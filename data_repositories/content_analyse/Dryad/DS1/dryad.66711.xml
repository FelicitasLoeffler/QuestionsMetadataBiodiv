The Excel worksheet includes a tab for each individual bird. Each tab shows the last five digits of the band number of the individual the TDR was attached to. The total band number is 996XXXXX where XXXXX is the last five digits and uniquely identifies the bird. Each recorder was attached to multiple birds, and downloaded at the end of the field season (it was not possible to download the TDR in the field, so it had to be sent to France to be opened, downloaded and destroyed). Each tab presents four columns: date-time, temperature in degrees C, pressure in mbar (note that surface pressure is ~1040 mbar [but varies among loggers] and should be subtracted to determine depth. To convert mbar into depth, divide by 1000) and luminosity in lux. As the TDR was attached to the leg via tape over the logger, the luminosity readings are not representative. The first data file shows that meta-data. As several of the TDRs quit part way through the season/never started, many of the birds for which the TDR was attached have no associated data.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>diving|resting metabolic rate|behavioural senescence|pace of life|cost of hypoxia|basal metabolic rate|rate of living theory|physiological senescence|time-depth recorder|accelerometer|Thick-billed murre</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
