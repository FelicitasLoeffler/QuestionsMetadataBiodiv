Specifically, resistance mutations are encoded with 1 or 2 (2 only applies to codon 120), and the non-resistant mutation with 0. The two data columns give the two mutations in order</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase|cardiotonic steroids|chemical ecology|toxin resistance|bufadienolides</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
