Year 19897 Aboveground biomass carbon/nitrogen</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>These gardens were started in order to establish monocultures of several species of native prairie plants common to Cedar Creek.  Several experimental applications will make use of them once the plants are established.  Seed from fifty different species was planted.	In the summer of 1992, LTER experiment 111 was initiated.  A new monoculture garden was set up adjacent to the existing competition gardens (LTER experiments 26, &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e055/e055.html"&gt;55&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e069/e069.html"&gt;69&lt;/A&gt; and 70).  The 160 total plots consist of two plot sizes, large (5'x8') and small (5'x4') were built using sheet metal pounded into the ground.  The entire garden is surrounded by a 6 foot tall fence above ground and a 4 foot tall fence below ground to exclude herbivores.  Seeds were planted in the fall of 1992.        Appropriate treatments were administered to each experiment and sampling was done according to sampling schedulesduring the 1992 field season.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition|Koeleria cristata|Solidago rigida|Agastache foeniculum|Panicum virgatum|Sorghastrum nutans|Petalostemum purpureum|Asclepias tuberosa|Ambrosia artemisiifolia elatior|Andropogon gerardi|Anemone cylindrica|Asclepias syriaca|Schizachyrium scoparium|Desmodium canadense|Carex sp.|Calamovilfa longifolia|Achillea millefolium(lanulosa)|Petalostemum candidum|Bouteloua curtipendula|Solidago nemoralis|Quercus macrocarpa|Agropyron repens|Asclepias verticillata|Aster novae-angliae|Aster azureus|Penstemon grandiflorus|Coreopsis palmata|Petalostemum villosum|Corylus americanus|Liatris aspera|Poa pratensis|Solidago speciosa|Lespedeza capitata|Rudbeckia serotina|Lupinus perennis|Stipa spartea|Potentilla arguta|Aster ericoides|Agrostis scabra</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
