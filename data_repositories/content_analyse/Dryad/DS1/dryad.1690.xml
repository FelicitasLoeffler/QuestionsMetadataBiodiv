Here I report the results from a quantitative-genetic experiment aimed at understanding the role of predation risk in the expression and evolution of life-history and mating-system traits in a hermaphroditic freshwater snail (Physa acuta).  I reared 30 full-sib families in four environments that factorially contrast predation risk and mate availability and measured age/size at first reproduction, growth rate, a morphological defense, and the early survival of outcrossed/selfed eggs that were laid under predator/no-predator conditions.  I evaluated the genetic basis of trade-offs among traits and the stability of the G matrix across environments.  Mating reduced growth while predation risk increased growth, but the effects of mating were weaker for predator-induced snails and the effects of predation risk were weaker for snails without mates.  Predation risk reduced the amount of time that individuals waited before self-fertilizing and reduced inbreeding depression in the offspring.  There was a positive among-family relationship between the amount of time that individuals delayed selfing under predation risk and the magnitude of inbreeding depression.  These results highlight several potential roles of enemies in mating-system expression and evolution.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Mating Systems|Life-History Evolution|Phenotypic Plasticity|Inbreeding|Predation|Quantitative Genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
