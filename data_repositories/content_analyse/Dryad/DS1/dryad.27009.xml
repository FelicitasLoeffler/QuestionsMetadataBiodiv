Year 1996 Month 3  Weed biomass</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>Biodiversity I (E123), also called the "small biodiversity experiment," was designed to determine how the number of species affects the dynamics of ecological processes at the population, community, and ecosystem levels. By experimentally manipulating the number of species and the kinds of species, the amount of plant growth and the change from year to year that result can be examined. Also, the effects of number of species on carbon and nitrogen in the soil and on the ability of other species to invade can be studied.The experiment contains 147 3 x 3m plots that were randomly allocated 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 plant species.The particular species in a plot were randomly selected from a set of 24 prairie-grassland species which included seven warm-season (C4) grasses, four cool-season (C3) grasses, four legumes, nine non-legume forbs. Each level of number of species has 20 to 24 replicates. In this experiment not all of the species are in monocultures.The study was established in 1994 by lead investigators David Tilman, David Wedin, Peter Reich, and Johannes Knops.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition|DIGITARIA ISCHAEMUM|MISCELLANEOUS GRASSES|CREPIS TECTORUM|ERIGERON CANADENSIS|MISCELLANEOUS FORBS|HEDEOMA HISPIDA|AGROPYRON REPENS|EUPHORBIA GLYPTOSPERMA|ANDROPOGON GERARDI|SOLIDAGO NEMORALIS|VERBASCUM THAPSUS|ASCLEPIAS TUBEROSA|PETALOSTEMUM PURPUREUM|LEPIDIUM DENSIFLORUM|PHYSALIS VIRGINIANA|SCHIZACHYRIUM SCOPARIUM|POTENTILLA RECTA|CYPERUS SP.|PANICUM OLIGOSANTHES|PHYSALIS SP.|AGROPYRON SMITHII|RUDBECKIA SEROTINA|POA PRATENSIS|AMBROSIA ARTEMISIIFOLIA ELATIOR|POLYGONOM SP.|ANEMONE CYLINDRICA|SILENE ANTIRRHINA|PANICUM SP.|EUPHORBIA COROLLATA|KOELERIA CRISTATA|POLYGONUM TENUE|AGROSTIS SP.|ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM (LANULOSA)|ASCLEPIAS SP.|ANENOME CYLINDRICA|CAREX SP.|ERIGERON STRIGOSUS|LYCHNIS ALBA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
