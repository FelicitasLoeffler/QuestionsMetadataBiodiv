Includes host-parasite encounter for different infective stage aggregation levels, condition-linked immunity (CLI)/removal of parasites, deaths of lowest condition hosts, and generalized linear models analyzing host condition-parasitism relations at the population and sample level.  Data output from running the model is approximately 1.4 GB.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aggregation|host condition|host immunity|infective stages|negative binomial|parasitism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
