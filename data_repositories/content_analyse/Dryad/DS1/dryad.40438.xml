Uniformity is strongly selected in breeding programs, usually automatically, as harvest equipment eliminates severely non-uniform individuals. Uniformity is genetically controlled, is known to be increased by interplant competition, and is predicted to increase upon abiotic stress. We mapped maize loci controlling genotype by environment interaction in plant height uniformity. These loci are different than the loci controlling mean plant height. Uniformity decreases upon combining two abiotic stresses, with alleles conferring greater uniformity in a single stress showing little improvement in a combined stress treatment. The maize B73 and Mo17 inbreds do not provide segregating alleles for improvement in plant height uniformity, suggesting that the genetic network specifying plant height has a past history of selection for robustness.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>QTL|maize|multiple stress|combined stress|abiotic|phenotype stability|uniformity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
