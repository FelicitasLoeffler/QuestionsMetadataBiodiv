Figure 5a was produced using the file zonalestarbeastfullintrons30.xml, Figure 5b with zonalestarbeast30.xml, Figure 5c with zonalestarbeastnuclear30.xml, Figure S2a with zonalestarbeasthalfintrons30.xml, Figure S2b with zonalestarbeastdnasp30.xml, Figure S2c with zonalestarbeastcytbcfzonale.xml, and Figure S2d with zonalestarbeastdnaspnuclear30.xml. The codes used to designate individuals in these files may be converted to the names of each individual listed in Appendices S2, S4 and S5 using the files tableofcytochromebsequences.xlsx and tableofnuclearsequences.xlsx.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biogeography|ichthyology|introgression|recombination|hybridization|species tree inference</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
