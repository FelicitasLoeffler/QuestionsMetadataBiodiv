Species abundance was determined by hand-collecting all the infaunal and epifaunal molluscs from within quadrats of known area in mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in fomalin, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species. Size distribution data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-0501a2.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|Detracia|Gemma|Geukensia|Hydrobiidae|Littoraria|Littorina|Melampus|mollusks|Polymesoda|spring|GCE|LTER|mid-marsh|abundance|community composition|creek bank|density|epifauna|infauna|intertidal|marshes|monitoring|permanent plots|species diversity|Populations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
