Both bands seen above the 100kDa marker band appear to be specific. (B) Extracts of staged embryos were blotted against Sdt and Actin.  (C-D) Heterozygous and zygotic mutant sdtK85 embryos were stained with anti Sdt and DAPI. Note that the morphology of sdtK85 mutant embryos is already disturbed. Scale bars = 50&#181;m.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cell polarity|Stardust|Crumbs</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
