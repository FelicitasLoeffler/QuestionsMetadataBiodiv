Maximum and minimum values are recorded instantaneously, with the sampling interval being  30 seconds, until 4 February 1991 at which time the sampling interval was changed to 2 seconds. Daily means and totals were  calculated from 2880 individual measurements until 4 February 1991 and 43200 after that date. This instrument was programmed to  generate both hourly and daily output. Parameters measured include solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed, wind vector, and wind direction.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|climate|weather|meteorology|temperature|solar radiation|relative humidity|barometric pressure|radiation|wind direction|wind speed</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
