Nesting males were collected during Spring 2012 (11 &#8211; 22 June). Isotopic compositions (&#948;13C and &#948;15N) of nesting male liver tissue and egg samples from the male&#8217;s nests are shown. Diet estimates of nesting males are shown based on % Littoral resource contributions to diet for each individual (see methods for details).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Natural selection|Sexual selection|Speciation|Fish|Morphometrics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
