The mean 1961-1990        climatology comprises a suite of eleven surface variables:        precipitation (PRE) and wet-day frequency (WET), mean, maximum        and minimum temperature (TMP, TMX, TMN), diurnal temperature        range (DTR), vapour pressure (VAP,) global radiation (RAD,)        cloud cover (CLD), frost frequency (FRS), and wind speed (WND).        The mean climate surfaces have been constructed from a new        dataset of station 1961-1990 climatological normals, numbering        between 19,800 (precipitation) and 3615 (windspeed). The station        data were interpolated as a function of latitude, longitude and        elevation using thin-plate splines. The accuracy of the        interpolations are assessed using cross-validation and by        comparison with other climatologies. this data-set has been        decsribed in: New,M., Hulme,M. and Jones,P.D. (1999)        Representing twentieth century space-time climate variability.
