Zooplankton samples are preserved in buffered formalin (up until the year 2000) or 80% ethanol (2001 onwards) and archived. Data are summed over sex and stage and integrated volumetrically over the water column to provide a lake-wide estimate of organisms per liter for each species.  A minimum of 5 samples per lake-year are identified and counted. Sampling Frequency: fortnightly during ice-free season - every 6 weeks during ice-covered seasonNumber of sites: 7</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|zooplankton|plankton|abundance|density</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
