A  subset of samples were also measured for total C, N, and P. Paired plots were randomly selected in locations where Kobresia and  Acomastylis populations were adjacent to one another. Soil samples were collected from 35 plots, 22 and 13 of which had southerly and northerly aspects, respectively. Soil cores were removed with 3.5-cm interior diameter PVC pipe that was driven into the tundra by use of  a rubber mallet. The minimum depth of individual cores was 9 cm, and  these depths were recorded at the time of removal (15 July, 19 July, 22  July, and 9 August 1993).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|Acomastylis rossii|K+|Kobresia myosuroides|bulk density|carbon|nitrogen|organic matter|phosphorus|soil|soil coresm|soil organic matter</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
