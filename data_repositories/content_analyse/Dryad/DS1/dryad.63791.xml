Data is divided into Own-or-Not where 1 reflects that the lizards and the habitat are the same, whereas 0 reflects that lizards come from a different location than the habitat squares. Habitat category reflects if the pair are both from an islet population (I), both from a mainland population (M) or from one islet- and one mainland population (IM).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Natural selection|Speciation|Predation release|Island gigantism|Population divergence</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
