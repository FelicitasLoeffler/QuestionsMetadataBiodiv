Zooplankton were sampled during the ice-free season near the point of maximum depth by using a metered, 76 &#956;m mesh, tow net. The net was deployed in 4 to 7 vertical hauls and its contents were combined to produce a composite that corrected for the diminution of lake stratum volume with depth. A minimum of 250 crustacean zooplankton were enumerated in each composite, subsampling to ensure that no taxon comprised more than 10% of the total count. Phytoplankton were sampled through the euphotic zone, and water chemistry samples were volume-weighted composites of all depths during isothermal periods, and of the mixed layers during periods of vernal and autumnal stratification. Dissolved oxygen profiles were generated at 1-2 m intervals from all depths. Finally, abundances of the zooplanktivore, Chaoborus spp. were quantified in samples from night-time vertical hauls at 10 stations visited during the autumn in all lakes in 1986 and in one lake from 1987-1994. In the laboratory, a minimum of 300 cells, colonies, or filaments of phytoplankton were counted within the Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Dinophyceae, and Euglenophyceae. Dimensions of all counted algae were measured, and summed to express values as an "edible" phytoplankton biovolume.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>lakes|calcium decline|jelly|jellification|nutrients</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
