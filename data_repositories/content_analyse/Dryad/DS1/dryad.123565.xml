It is well established that monocular blurring of vision results in decreased stereoacuity. However, previous studies have used tests that are broadband in their spatial frequency content. It is not yet entirely clear how the processing of stereopsis in different spatial frequency channels is altered in response to binocular input imbalance. Here, we applied a new stereoacuity test based on narrow-band Gabor stimuli. By manipulating the carrier spatial frequency, we were able to reveal the spatial frequency tuning of stereopsis, spanning from coarse to fine, under blurred conditions. Our findings show that increasing monocular blur elevates stereoacuity thresholds &#8216;selectively&#8217; at high spatial frequencies, gradually shifting the optimum frequency to lower spatial frequencies. Surprisingly, stereopsis for low frequency targets was only mildly affected even with an acuity difference of eight lines on a standard letter chart. Furthermore, we examined the effect of monocular blur on the size tuning function of stereopsis. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>stereoacuity|visual acuity|coarse and fine stereopsis|optimal observer|anisometropic amblyopia</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
