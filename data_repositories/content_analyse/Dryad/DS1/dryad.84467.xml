The programs can be used to simulate genotype data under different migration and mutation models, and to calculate Gst, Hs, and their correlation from the simulated genotype data.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Conservation Genetics|Ecological Genetics|Population Genetics - Theoretical|Inbreeding</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
