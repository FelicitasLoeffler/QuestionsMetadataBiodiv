Only species that were recaptured in both habitats and moved to a different trap are included in the dataset (n=12 species).Column headings: UniqueIDF: Unique number given to every forest individual to study its movement. TotDistF: Total distance moved (m) by each forest individual that moved to a different trap. UniqueIDP: Unique number given to every plantation individual to study its movement. TotDistP: Total distance moved (m) by each plantation individual that moved to a different trap.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Connectivity|Deforestation|Habitat boundaries|Oil palm agriculture</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
