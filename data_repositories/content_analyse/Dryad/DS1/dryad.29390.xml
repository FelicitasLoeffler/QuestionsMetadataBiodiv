The transects were run twice in 1989, once in late May and once in early August to monitor potential responses in"cool season" and"warm season" plants.Each site contains four 400 meter transects which represent a 1 kilometer-squared box.  The transects occupy a roughly north/south azimuth.  The northwest and southwest transects are 100 meters from the western edge of the box and the eastern transects are similarly placed 100 meters in from the eastern box side, leaving 800 meters between the eastern and western transects.  The northeast and northwest transects begin at the northern edge of the box.  After an interval of 200 meters the southern two transects begin, terminating at the southern edge of the box.Each site consists of a 1km-squared box that contains four 400m transects with a north/south orientation.  The transects are 100m in from the eastern and western box edges.  The northern and southern transects are contiguous with the northern and southern box edges respectively, leaving 200m between the northern and southern transects and 800m between the eastern and western transects.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>SEV|LTER|plant|percent cover</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
