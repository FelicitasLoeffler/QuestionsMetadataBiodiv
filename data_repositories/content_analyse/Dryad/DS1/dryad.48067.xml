Embryos express Bcd-GFP fusion protein in a bcdE1 null mutant background (flyline 2XA). For 23 embryos two time points are provided: 16+/-2 min after mitosis 13 (for Bicoid gradient measurement) and 67+/-2 min after mitosis 13 (for cephalic furrow position measurement). Two additional embryos are provided for early time point (09 and 12), three additional embryos are provided for late time point (15, 24 and 28). Embryo 05 is missing from dataset. This dataset reproduces gradients in Figure 1C of main text.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bicoid|gene regulatory networks|gap genes|pattern formation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
