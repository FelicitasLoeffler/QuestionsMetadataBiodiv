Fish- DFG Striped Bass Population estimates and stocking data</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>Abundance estimates by age-class and sex have are made using tag and recapture methods. Striped bass are tagged on the San Joaquin River and Sacramento River and released on their spring spawning migrations. Each tagged fish is measured, sexed and aged. A year-round creel census is conducted to learn the tagged to untagged ratio and to determine the size and age composition of catch. Tag returns (corrected for non-response using reward tags) are used to estimate annual harvest rates, mortality rates and migrations of striped bass.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
