Five plates were deployed and retrieved from the high, mid, and low barnacle subzones at four localities then taken to the laboratory where newly metamorphosed spat and cyprid larvae were identified to species level under a dissecting microscope. The time plates were exposed in the field varied somewhat depending on tidal cycles and sea conditions.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Competition|Dispersal|Ecology: community|Ecology: experimental|Fitness|Metacommunities|Population: dynamics|Trade offs|Ocean|Invertebrates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
