We dissected froglets one after they had completed tail resorption.  The file provides the rearing density, tank number and froglet ID for each individual.  There are snout vent lengths and body masses for each individual, as well as liver masses, fat body masses, and total gut masses.  There are also measures of length and projected area for each section of the gut including the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.  These values were obtained by photographing the gut and a ruler from above and analyzing the photo using ImageJ software from the National Institute of Health.  The area represents the area of each gut section as seen in the photo, not the surface area of the gut.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>compensatory growth|complex life cycle|diet retention time|gut plasticity|intake|latent effects|metamorph|Neotropical treefrog</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
