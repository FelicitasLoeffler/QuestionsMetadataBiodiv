It is also used by students as the site for research projects that are  connected with these field classes.          	During the spring one of the classes discovered two species of terrestrial molluscs (snails) that were not known to occur in this area. They both are reported to have a rather limited distribution. The name of one of these animals has not been definitely established yet, although both have been identified to genus. They are:          Helminthoglypta tudiculata          Glyptostoma sp. either gabrielense or newberrianum          	Some permanent plant and animal transects have been established on this Reserve. We plan eventually to have these transects located on a map of the Reserve so that they may be used by any groups that desire to do so.          	Some photo sites have also been established, so that a photographic record of the Reserve can be maintained from known locations. Pictures will be taken along marked compass bearings from each of these sites so that changes which may occur on the Reserve will be recorded.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>molluscs</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
