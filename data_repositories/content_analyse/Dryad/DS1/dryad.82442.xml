The tree was rooted with Bombus ignitus and Apis mellifera. Numbers above the branch are clade credibility for maximum likelihood and for Bayesian analysis below the branch.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Conservation Biology|Conservation Genetics|Ecological Genetics|Population Ecology</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
