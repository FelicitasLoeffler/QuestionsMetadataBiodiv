Dispersal andvicariance events in the Pleistocene have received the most attention, though recent studies suggest a potentially moreancient history to components of the terrestrial fauna. Among this fauna is the enigmatic archaeobatrachian frog genusBarbourula, which only occurs on the islands of Borneo and Palawan. We utilize this lineage to gain unique insight into thetemporal history of lineage diversification in Southeast Asian islands.Methodology/Principal Findings: Using mitochondrial and nuclear genetic data, multiple fossil calibration points, andlikelihood and Bayesian methods, we estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times for Barbourula. We determinethe sensitivity of focal divergence times to specific calibration points by jackknife approach in which each calibration point isexcluded from analysis. We find that relevant divergence time estimates are robust to the exclusion of specific calibrationpoints. Barbourula is recovered as a monophyletic lineage nested within a monophyletic Costata. Barbourula diverged from itssister taxon Bombina in the Paleogene and the two species of Barbourula diverged in the Late Miocene.Conclusions/Significance: The divergences within Barbourula and between it and Bombina are surprisingly old andrepresent the oldest estimates for a cladogenetic event resulting in living taxa endemic to Southeast Asian islands.Moreover, these divergence time estimates are consistent with a new biogeographic scenario: the Palawan Ark Hypothesis.We suggest that components of Palawan&#8217;s terrestrial fauna might have &#8216;&#8216;rafted&#8217;&#8217; on emergent portions of the North PalawanBlock during its migration from the Asian mainland to its present-day position near Borneo. Further, dispersal from Palawanto Borneo (rather than Borneo to Palawan) may explain the current day disjunct distribution of this ancient lineage.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Phylogenetics|Divergence Time Estimation|Biogeography</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
