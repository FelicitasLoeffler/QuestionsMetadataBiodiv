These experiments        represent a large step forward in the way climate change is        modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario        construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major        difficulties that were associated with the previous generations        of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa        IPCC 1992) climate change experiments.  HadCM2 has a spatial        resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude)        and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73        grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about        417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and        South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42).  The        equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the        global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2        concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this        quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat        lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a        'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model        with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative        forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley        Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with        forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et        al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995.  The greenhouse gas only        integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the        greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further        series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent        CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate        aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in        forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the        early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The        addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols        represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic        sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface        albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to        Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect        effects of aerosols were not simulated.  The modelled control        climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air        temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04        degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such        experiments.  HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous        generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre        (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995).  The experiments        performed have simulated the observed climate system using        estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995)        and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's        sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The        agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record        and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS        than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the        observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than        HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record.  The climate        sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CThe A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful        economic development, in which regional averages of income per        capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich        countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family,        demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence        is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality        and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion        by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age        increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through        their accumulated savings in private pension systems.  The        global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three        percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average        global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a        global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are        unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about        US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per        capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health        and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is        not without its problems. In particular, many communities could        face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the        wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places        income growth could come with increased pressure on the global        commons.  Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this        scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both        reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and        increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy        intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average        annual rate of 1.3 percent.  With the rapid increase in income,        dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased        consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease        subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging        society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership,        sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks,        nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than        income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in        a considerable intensification of agriculture.  Three scenario        groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the        uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion        technologies in this rapidly changing world.  Near-term        investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities        into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration        or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of        energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions,        but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the        variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive        scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2        scenarios, conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor        productivity or of rapid progress in &amp;quot,post-fossil&amp;quot,        energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of        B1 and B2.  These scenario variants have been introduced into        the A1 storyline because of its &amp;quot,high growth with high        tech&amp;quot, nature, where differences in alternative technology        developments translate into large differences in future GHG        emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in        this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a        utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy.        The concept of environmental quality might change in this        storyline from &amp;quot,conservation&amp;quot, of nature to active        &amp;quot,management&amp;quot, - and marketing - of natural and        environmental services.
