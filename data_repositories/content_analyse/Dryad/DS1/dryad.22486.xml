Each yearly download contains additional residential housing characteristics as available for parcels included in the CAMA Database and the CAMA supplementary databases for each jurisdiction..  Documentation for CAMA, including thorough definitions for all attributes is enclosed.  Complete Property View documentation can be found at http://www.mdp.state.md.us/data/index.htm under the "Technical Background" tab. It should be noted that the CAMA Database consists of points and not parcel boundaries.  For those areas where parcel polygon data exists the CAMA Database  can be joined using the ACCTID or a concatenation of the BLOCK and LOT fields, whichever is appropriate.  (Spaces may have to be excluded when concatenating the BLOCK and LOT fields). A cursory review of the 2004 version of the CAMA Database indicates that it has more accurate data when compared with the 2003 version, particularly with respect to dwelling types.  However, for a given record it is not uncommon for numerous fields to be missing attributes.  Based on previous version of the CAMA Database it is also not unlikely that some of the information is inaccurate.  This layer was edited to remove points that did not have a valid location because they failed to geocode.  There were 235 such points.  A listing of the deleted points is in the table with the suffix "DeletedRecords."</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Baltimore City|Maryland|MSA</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
