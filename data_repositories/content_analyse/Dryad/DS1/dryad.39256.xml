Presented are four selection treatments (C = Control, T = Trend, R = Red noise, W = White noise). split temp = two temperature environments the beetles were exposed to during the split brood experiment. replicate: replicate is nested within treatment(4 replicates per treatment). time point: time point of beetle collection during their emergence period (1 = early, 2 = intermediate, 3 = late hatching individuals). Fam = Family nested within replicate and treatment, per replicate 10 families were investigated. sex = sex of the individual measured. body mass = dry weight of beetle.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Experimental evolution|Environmental change|Genetic variance|Split brood experiment|Sex specific plasticity|Sex specific environmental sensitivity|Insects|Genetic correlations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
