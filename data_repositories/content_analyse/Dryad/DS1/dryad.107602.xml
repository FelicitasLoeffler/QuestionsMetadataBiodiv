From M&amp;M: The measurement was performed on a WITec alpha300 confocal Raman microscope, using a 50 &#181;m pinhole and a Zeiss LD plan-NEOFLUAR 20&#215;/0.4 corr air objective with coverslip correction. 20&#215; magnification was used in order to keep as many bacteria as possible in the focal plane while still resolving individual bacteria. The excitation wavelength was 532 nm, with laser power of 3 mW at the focal plane. The Raman detector was a newton EMCCD camera cooled to -60o C with a 600 g/mm grating. Integration time was 1 second and lateral resolution 2 pixel/&#181;m. The file was exported in ASCII format.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Confocal Raman Microscopy|proxy component spectra|biofilm image scans|WiTec Alpha300</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
