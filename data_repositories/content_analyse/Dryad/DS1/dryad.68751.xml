This database also includes information on linking other associated data files such as hydrologic models. Data include floodplain vegetation along belt transects such as tree species and elevations. Flooding regime as calculated by associated models is also summarized in the database.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>bottomland forests|environmental flows|flow alteration|invasion resistance|riparian vegetation|river channel design|vegetation zonation|floodplain forests|shrub swamp</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
