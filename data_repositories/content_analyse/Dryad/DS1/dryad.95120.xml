Petal length and width measurements are in mm, downy mildew score was a 0&#8211;5 scale based on the percentage of leaves infected (0 = 0%, 1 = 1&#8211;25%, 2 = 25&#8211;50%, 3 = 50&#8211;75%, and 4 = 75&#8211;100%), flowers_observed is the total number of flowers open on days when pollinator surveys took place, pieris_proportion_visited and honeybee_proportion_visited are the proportion of flowers probed based on the total number of flowers open on days when surveys took place, pieris_probeduration and honeybee_probeduration are reported in seconds.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi|downy mildew|indirect effects|mutualism|pollinator|volatile organic compounds|plant&#8211;herbivore interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
