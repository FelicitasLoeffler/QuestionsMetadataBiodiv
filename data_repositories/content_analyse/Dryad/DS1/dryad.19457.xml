Measurements were collected using micro-T Temperature Logger (NexSens DS1921G) beginning 2009-05-08. Bionic mussel temperature loggers are contained within an artificial mussel in the middle of the mussel bed. There are typically two replicates with two loggers within each replicate.  These are distinguished in the file name as follows: R11 - replicate 1, 1st logger, R12 - replicate 1, 2nd logger, R21 - replicate 2, 1st logger, R22 - replicate 2, 2nd logger. Temperature is recorded at 60.0 minute intervals.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>EARTH SCIENCE : Oceans : Ocean Temperature : Water Temperature|Temperature|Integrated Ocean Observing System|IOOS|Oceanographic Sensor Data|Intertidal Temperature Data|continental shelf|seawater|temperature|Oregon|United States of America|PISCO</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
