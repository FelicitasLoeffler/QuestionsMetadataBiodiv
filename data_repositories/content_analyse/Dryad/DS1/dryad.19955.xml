These start from 1880        to avoid the &amp;quot,cold start problem&amp;quot,.  This version of        the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in        the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to        earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global        mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02        degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction.        The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal        resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees).        The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21        levels.  The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed        layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the        high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995,        Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model        combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into        an &amp;quot,equivalent&amp;quot, CO2 concentration. Observed        concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a        projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year        compounding increase of equivalent CO2.  Another model        experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from        atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is        included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to        the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995)        and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are        the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the        chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a        present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4        W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas        forcing of about 2 W/m^2.  The magnitude of the 20th century        warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed        reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing        from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect        effect and the effect of soot.  The climate sensitivity of        CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of        environmental and social consciousness combined with a globally        coherent approach to sustainable development. A strong welfare        net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However,        counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not        conform to the main social and environmental intentions of the        mainstream in this scenario family. Particular effort is devoted        to increasing resource efficiency. Comprehensive incentive        systems, combined with advances in international institutions,        permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. R and D to        this end is also enhanced together with education and capacity        building for clean and equitable development. Organizational        measures are adopted to reduce material wastage, maximizing        reuse and recycling. The combination of technical and        organizational change yields high levels of material and energy        saving as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity        also improves as a byproduct of these efforts. Variants        considered within the B1 family of scenarios include different        rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., energy        intensity declines). The demographic transition to low mortality        and fertility occurs at the same rate as in A1 but for slightly        different reasons, motivated partly by social and environmental        concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and        declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with        high levels of economic activity and significant and deliberate        progress toward international and national income equality.        Global income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000, somewhat        lower than in A1. A higher proportion of this income is spent on        services rather than on material goods, and on quality rather        than quantity, because of less emphasis on material goods and        also higher resource prices.  The B1 storyline sees a relatively        smooth transition to alternative energy systems as conventional        oil resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional        and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during        the transition, but the major push is towards post fossil        technologies driven in large part by environmental concerns.        Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional        effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is        high, as most potentially negative environmental aspects of        rapid development are anticipated and dealt with effectively        locally, nationally, and internationally. For example,        transboundary air pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated        in the long-term. Land-use is carefully managed to counteract        the impacts of activities potentially damaging to the        environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and        non-motorized transport, with suburban developments tightly        controlled. Strong incentives for low-input, low-impact        agriculture along with maintenance of large areas of wilderness        contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat        consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional        environmental measures and policies also lead to relatively low        GHG emissions even in the absence of explicit interventions        directed at mitigating climate change.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate|global climate change|precipitation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
