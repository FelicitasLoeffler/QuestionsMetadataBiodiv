These experiments        represent a large step forward in the way climate change is        modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario        construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major        difficulties that were associated with the previous generations        of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa        IPCC 1992) climate change experiments.  HadCM2 has a spatial        resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude)        and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73        grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about        417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and        South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42).  The        equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the        global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2        concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this        quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat        lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a        'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model        with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative        forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley        Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with        forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et        al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995.  The greenhouse gas only        integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the        greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further        series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent        CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate        aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in        forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the        early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The        addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols        represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic        sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface        albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to        Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect        effects of aerosols were not simulated.  The modelled control        climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air        temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04        degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such        experiments.  HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous        generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre        (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995).  The experiments        performed have simulated the observed climate system using        estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995)        and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's        sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The        agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record        and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS        than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the        observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than        HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record.  The climate        sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFor the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a        strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to        family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a        series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing        local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious        participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to        focus attention on contributing to the local community.        Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in        education and science and growth in economic productivity.        Social and political structures diversify, with some regions        moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income        inequality, while others move towards &amp;quot,lean&amp;quot,        government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although        some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control        and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees        more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or        B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology        diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and        hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the        emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline        only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this        scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by        2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the        A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in        2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in        others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments,        culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and        mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies,        while those poor in resources place very high priority on        minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to        improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs.        The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by        resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in        terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but        resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil        technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability,        nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and        low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older        fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements,        agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for        innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels        of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through        the local development of more sustainable high-yield        agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and        regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions.        For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in        Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production        but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified        exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world        sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high        GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four        scenario families.
