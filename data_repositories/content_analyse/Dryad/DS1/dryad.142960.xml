Three mitochondrial and three nuclear fragments were analyzed. The results indicate clear differences in the genetic diversity of the two species, but with ample sharing of haplotypes in all the markers analyzed, reflecting the absence of reciprocal monophyly, presumably due to the relatively recent and still incomplete separation of the two species. The paleoclimatic distribution models, together with the observed genetic profile indicate a recent process of divergence by geographic isolation in the ancestral populations of the two species. This scenario coincides with the recent climatic events of the South American dry diagonal, which involves the gallery forests of the Cerrado biome and the cloud forest enclaves of the seasonal tropical dry forest of the Caatinga between the late Pleistocene and the mid Holocene.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Diversification|multilocus|species distribuition modeling</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
