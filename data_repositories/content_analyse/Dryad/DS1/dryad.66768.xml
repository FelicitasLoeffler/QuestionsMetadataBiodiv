We noted the number of visits to each subspecies. We also noted the different numbers of each transition type. Transition categories are detoed "from_to" (i.e. "x_p" transition was from a xantiana to a parviflora). We also noted that parviflora may have different colors (pp = pink, wp = white, up = unknown) and the should sum to the category with only a "p". We also have separate entries using all flowers or plants only (no geitnogamy). The entries with all flowers used end in "_f".</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Hybridization|Mating System|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility|pollination|self-fertilization|Speciation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
