All vascular species were sorted, divided into new and old growth, dried, and weighed. Lichens were separated by genus in all quadrats. In half of the quadrats (n=4), mosses were separated by species. Moss and lichen data are presented by species elsewhere (see 97lgmosslichen.txt).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Alaska|biomass|productivity|mosses|tundra|species diversity|primary production|organic matter|populations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
