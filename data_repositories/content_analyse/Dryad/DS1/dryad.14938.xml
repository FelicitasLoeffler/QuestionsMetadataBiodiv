It is included in the VCR LTER database for comparative purposes. The data itself consists of trapping records for 10x10 trapping grids with 7.6m (25 foot) trap spacing. (note: grid 5 had an unusual geometry due to size constraints). Up to 4 captures of an individual may be recorded on each line of data.Trapping used modified Fitch live traps with a #10 tin can as the main chamber. Traps were baited with cracked corn or hen scratch and run for 3 sequential nights in each trapping session.In addition to the basic trapping data, there are additional files such as a fortran program for detecting inconsistencies in the data (KCHECK.FOR), a listing of known problems (ERRORLIS), a program for calculating Minimum Number Known Alive (MNAPROG.FOR) and a file containing minimum number alive (BIRDMNA.DAT) for each grid, week, sex and species combination.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Populations|Biodiversity|Meadw vole|Microtus pennsylvanicus</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
