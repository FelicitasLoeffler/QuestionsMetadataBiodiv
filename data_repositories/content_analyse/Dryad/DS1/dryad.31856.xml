Temperature and snow density were  measured at various depths throughout the snow cover profiles in order to characterize the temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) of the snowpack throughout the year. Snow density was measured at 10-cm intervals using a 1000-ml cutter. Data on snow grain qualities were collected beginning in the 1994-95 snow season. Snow samples were  collected and analyzed for cations and anions at the Mountain Research  Station's Kiowa Laboratory.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|Saddle grid|anions|cations|pH|snow|snow chemistry|snow pit|snow profile|snow water equivalen</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
