Sheet 1: msats_Alaskan_caribou Microsatellite genotypes at 19 loci for 655 caribou from 20 populations (herds). Microsatellite allele sizes are in base pairs. Missing data is indicated by '0'. Sheet 2: CBfactors_herdpairs_n&gt;4 Pairwise data for genetic differentiation, geographic distance, harmonic mean population size, and landscape features. Includes 172 herd pairs representing all possible pairs of herds except Wolf Mountain (WOLF, n=4). Please read the Molecular Ecology manuscript by Mager et al., including the Supplementary Online Resources, for details on how these data were generated and how they were used in Mantel and Random Forests analyses.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Landscape Genetics|Microsatellites|Population structure|Rangifer tarandus|Random Forests</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
