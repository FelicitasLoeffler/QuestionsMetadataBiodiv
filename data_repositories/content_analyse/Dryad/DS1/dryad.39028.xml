The sites are: CRA: Conard Environmental Research Area, Grinnell College, Kellogg, IA (interior-loam), MAR: Iowa River Conservation Area, Marshalltown, IA (interior-sand), SCW: St. Croix Watershed Research Station, Marine-on-St. Croix, MN (edge-loam) NOTE: this site was planted later than the others due to replanting after planting at a first site (UM ag fields) failed, CC: Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Univ. of Minnesota, East Bethel, MN (edge-sand), KEN: Kensington Runestone Park, Kensington, MN (beyond-loam), IDA: Lake Ida, 3223 Sahara LN NW (property of Sheila Stanton), Alexandria, MN (beyond-sand). Data collected include early-season survival, which includes both germination and survival for the first two weeks, about 3-4 weeks after planting.  About eight weeks after planing, I collected data on mid-season survival, reproductive stage, height, leaf number, and collected the top-most fully expanded leaf to calculate SLA. At the end of the growing season, I recorded height, branch number and collected a subsample of ~10% of the seedpods on a plant.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>aster models|fitness|local adaptation|soil type|range limit</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
