For each chromosome, there is a file containing the genotypes (ending in "012NA"), a file containing the list of individuals (ending in "012.indv"), and a file containing the list of positions on the chromosome (ending in "012.pos"). For details of how these files were produced see the file "GW_islands_of_diff_processing_scripts.txt", also provided in this Dryad package. These files are ready to be used for subsequent analysis and presentation in the R scripts supplied in this package. The metadata file ("GW_Lane5_plus_Liz.nine-taxa.Fst_groups.txt", also in this package) will be needed in the R processing.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>genomic differentiation|greenish warbler|linked selection|Phylloscopus trochiloides|selective sweep|Speciation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
