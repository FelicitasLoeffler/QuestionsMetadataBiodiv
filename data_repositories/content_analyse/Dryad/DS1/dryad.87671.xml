The subdirectory /isomerization includes five forced switching simulation trajectories from cis-gluazo to trans-gluazo. The subdirectory /umbrella-clamshell includes the files needed to reproduce the umbrella sampling simulation results of LBD clamshell motions of GluK2-cis complex. This data file could be used to reproduce all the results of GluK2-cis complex presented in the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>molecular dynamics|umbrella sampling|photoisomerization|GluK2|photochromic ligand</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
