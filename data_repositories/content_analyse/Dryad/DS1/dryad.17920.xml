A      sampling regime of collections made at regular biweekly intervals was      implemented to provide the best quantitative assessment of long term     changes in the zooplankton population dynamics.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgetown|South Carolina</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
