Each folder refers to one individual bird (cross-referenced with doubly-labelled water data). The file name within each folder refers to the CSV file created by the CEFAS program and has the logger ID and the date the file was created (downloaded). The data file provides date/time, depth (pressure in dbars which is generally equivalent to depth in m) and acceleration in three dimensions at 25 Hz (in g), after a preamble generated by the logger that includes the daylog. Note that data is partitioned into two sections. The first section has data every 1 s, the second section has data at 25 Hz in the "fast log", for five files, the fine-scale (25 Hz) data was only recorded when the bird was diving.
