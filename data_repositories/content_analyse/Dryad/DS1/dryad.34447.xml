Columns mUVhalf, nmUVmax, nmRedhalf, res358, res570 and res707 show data from spectrometric beak colour measurements (for details see publication). DimDAad is the discriminant function score that was used for QTL mapping. F_Gen, FBroodID, Wline and Session are the identifiers for the mother, the brood of rearing, the maternal line and the measuring session, respectively. Age120 is an age identifier (in days). F is the inbreeding coefficient. Sex is the sex of the subject (0=females, 1=males).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Evolutionary Genomics|Genetic Variation|Heritability|Quantitative Genetics|Selection - Sexual|QTL Analysis</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
