Results produced in edgeR from associated RSEM individual expression count files (See attached archive). In edgeR testing was conducted using the classic approach for two groups, CPM-filtered counts were TMM-normalised, quantile-adjusted conditional maximum likelihood method was used to estimate dispersions and the exact test was used to call differentially expressed genes and compute p-values. Columns are: transcript ID, Log Fold-change between the regions (-ve values donate down-regulation in the West and +ve the opposite), Log CPM (counts per million mapped reads), P-value of differential expression, FDR is False discovery rate.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Rapid evolution|Invasive Species|Cane toad|Transriptomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
