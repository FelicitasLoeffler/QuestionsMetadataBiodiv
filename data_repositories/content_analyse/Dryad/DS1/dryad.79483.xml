These cues fluctuate with the signaller's hormonal condition, coincident with and informative about relevant aspects of its reproductive state, such as pubertal onset, change in season and, in females, timing of ovulation. Although pregnancy dramatically alters a female's endocrine profiles, which can be further influenced by fetal sex, the relationship between gestation and olfactory cues is poorly understood. We therefore examined the effects of pregnancy and fetal sex on volatile genital secretions in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), a strepsirrhine primate possessing complex olfactory mechanisms of reproductive signalling. While pregnant, dams altered and dampened their expression of volatile chemicals, with compound richness being particularly reduced in dams bearing sons. These changes were comparable in magnitude with other, published chemical differences among lemurs that are salient to conspecifics. Such olfactory &#8216;signatures&#8217; of pregnancy may help guide social interactions, potentially promoting mother&#8211;infant recognition, reducing intragroup conflict or counteracting behavioural mechanisms of paternity confusion, cues that also advertise fetal sex may additionally facilitate differential sex allocation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>olfactory communication|reproductive signal|gestation|sex allocation|hormone|chemosignal</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
