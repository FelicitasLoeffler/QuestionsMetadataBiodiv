However, consistently applicable generalisations about dispersal across scales are mostly absent because of the constraints on measuring propagule dispersal distances for many species. Here, we focus on fleshy-fruited taxa, specifically taxa with large fleshy fruits and their dispersers across an entire continental rainforest biome. We compare species-level results of whole-chloroplast DNA analyses in sister taxa with large and small fruits, to regional plot-based samples (310 plots), and whole of continent patterns for the distribution of woody species with either large (&gt;30mm) or smaller fleshy fruits (1093 taxa). The pairwise genomic comparison found higher genetic distances between populations and between regions in the large-fruited species (Endiandra globosa), but higher overall diversity within the small-fruited species (Endiandra discolor). Floristic comparisons among plots confirmed lower numbers of large-fruited species in areas where more extreme rainforest contraction occurred, and re-colonisation by small-fruited species readily dispersed by the available fauna. Species distribution patterns showed that larger-fruited species had smaller geographic ranges than smaller-fruited species and locations with stable refugia (and high endemism) aligned with concentrations of large fleshy-fruited taxa, making them a potentially valuable conservation-planning indicator.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Chloroplast genome|Dispersal|Fruit size|Next Generation Sequencing|Rainforest assembly</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
