To understand whether such population differentiation may reflect low levels of dispersal and gene flow at a very small spatial scale, we examined population structure and gene flow by analysing variation at 11 microsatellite loci among four geographically close localities (&lt;26&#8201;km apart) sampled within the distribution range of one of the colour forms, the brown-headed brown form. Our results revealed levels of genetic differentiation that are exceptionally high for birds at such a small spatial scale. This strong population structure appears to reflect low levels of historical and contemporary gene flow among populations, unless very close geographically (&lt;10&#8201;km). Thus, we suggest that the R&#233;union grey white-eye shows an extremely reduced propensity to disperse, which is likely to be related to behavioural processes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>White-eye|microsatellites|population differentiation|birds|passerine</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
