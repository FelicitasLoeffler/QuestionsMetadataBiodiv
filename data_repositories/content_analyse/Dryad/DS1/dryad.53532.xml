Each gzip file contains a large FASTQ sequence file. Files contain congruent sequences from the paired-end run. For example, the first entry from file set 1 contains the first half of the read pair, while the first entry from file set 2 contains the second half of the read pair. There are 9015656 sequences in each file, and each sequence uses 4 lines in the file (consistent with the FASTQ format). These data can be used to reproduce the "Benchmarking and Code Performance" section of the manuscript associated with this Dryad submission.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>next generation sequencing|Python|microsatellite discovery</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
