The identification of alleles associated with phenotypic variations is a rapidly developing area of research. We studied the genetic basis of phenotypic variations in 11 populations of wild pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) on two North-South aridity gradients, one in Niger and one in Mali. Most of the 11 phenotypic traits assessed in a common garden experiment varied between the populations studied. Moreover, the size of the inflorescence, the number of flowers and aboveground dry mass co-varied positively with a decrease in rainfall. To decipher the genetic basis of these phenotypes, we used an association mapping strategy with a mixed model. We found two SNPs on the same myosin XI contig significantly associated with variations in the average number of flowers. Both the allele frequency of the two SNPs and the average number of flowers co-varied with the rainfall gradient on the two gradients. Interestingly, this gene was also a target of selection during domestication. The Myosin XI gene is thus a good candidate for fitness-related adaptation in wild populations.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>adaptation|association|pearl millet|climate variation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
