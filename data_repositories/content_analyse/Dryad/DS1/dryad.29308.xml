In partnership with the US Geological Survey's National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) Program, FRAMES is implementing web-based technologies that can help bridge the gap between science and management. The goal is to make wildland fire data, metadata, tools, and other information resources easy to find, access, distribute, compare, and use. In collaboration, the wildland fire research and management communities can use these technologies to help eliminate redundancy, reduce costs, and promote increased productivity and efficiency. An NCEAS working group proposed this website.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Fire|wildland fire|fire management</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
