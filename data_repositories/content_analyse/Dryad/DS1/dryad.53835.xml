Each matrix includes only that part of the locus remaining after removing any portions which resulted in positive tests of recombination, and also after removing gaps found in more than half of all alleles. Each matrix contains the sequence of each distinct allele found at that locus. The name of each sequence is the name of the allele that sequence represents. These matrices are the ones used to create the trees in Figure 4 and Figure S1. zonalenedd4lfinalmatrixsmallerportion.nex is the matrix used to produce Figure S3.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biogeography|ichthyology|introgression|recombination|hybridization|species tree inference</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
