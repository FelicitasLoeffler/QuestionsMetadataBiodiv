The parameters used to simulate Model 5 were identical to those used for Model 2, except that the migration rates between subpopulations within and between archipelagos were doubled (set to 0.02 &amp; 0.002 respectively) (cf. Table S1 for Fst values).The files, in Fstat format, were created by the EASYPOP program.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>STRUCTURE software|hierarchical structure|genetic differentiation|sampling scheme|clustering algorithm</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
