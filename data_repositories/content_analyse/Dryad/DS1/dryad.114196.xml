Within each file, rows correspond with different SNVs and the values on each row give the posterior mean, median, and lower and upper bounds of the 95% CIs for the frequency of one of the two alleles at the locus.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Selection - Experimental|Population Genetics|Plant-Insect Interaction</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
