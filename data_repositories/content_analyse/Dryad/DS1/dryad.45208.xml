The file contains several sheets, the last sheet "Notes"  describes each sheet separately. The sheet TD shows the transitions datas collected in the field, and the other TD... sheets are the transition data transformed in order to obtain a correct format for data analysis. The TDComptor sheet is a kind of resume that has been used for statistical analysis of the data using mainly JMP and R, and BI &amp; ERI Analysor (B) contains all the information for the BI analysis. See further explanations in the publication and in the Note sheet. All the statistical analysis, graphs, data presented in the publication comes from this file and its monospecific equivalent (context). Note this file is active, please be careful with the formulae.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Behavior|Reproductive Isolation|Plant-Insect Interaction|Introgression|Hybridization</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
