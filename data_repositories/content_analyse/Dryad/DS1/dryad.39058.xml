The number of alleles per locus ranged from two to nine, and median observed heterozygosity was 0.435.Conclusions: This large number of polymorphic loci will enable researchers to quantify male fitness, patterns of multiple pa- ternity, selfing, and biparental inbreeding in large natural populations of this species. These markers will also permit detailed study of fine-scale patterns of genetic structure.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Illumina|microsatellite|Pal_finder</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
