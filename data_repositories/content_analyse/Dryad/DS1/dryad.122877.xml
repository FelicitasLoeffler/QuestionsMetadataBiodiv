Column Names -- "Block" is a number 1-5 that represents the spatial block in which the plant is located within the greenhouse, "Plant_ID" is a unique number used to identify each plant in the experiment, "Myco_fungi" and "Rhizobia" indicates the presence (+) or absence (-) of mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia treatments, "Shoot_mass" and "Root_mass" are the aboveground and belowground biomasses of the plants at harvest, and "Nodule_count" and "Nodule_mass" provide the number and mass of rhizobia nodules. Note that almost all plants have aboveground data while many lack belowground data, which is because roots of half the plants were flash frozen and homogenized for RNA-Seq and expression analysis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Transcriptome|RNA-Seq|rhizobia|legume|MME|symbiosis|mutualism|mycorrhizal fungi|Medicago|multiple mutualism effects|multispecies mutualism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
