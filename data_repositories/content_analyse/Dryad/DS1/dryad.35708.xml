The data is derived from direct sequencing, inferring polymorphisms from double peaks in the chromatograms. Haplotypes were determined by analytically phasing the data across all sequences using the program PHASE. Inferred sequence before phasing can be obtained in Genbank. The file includes a treeblock containing a neighbor-joining tree constructed from this data using PAUP* and used in the study.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Heliconius|M&#252;llerian mimicry|optix|phylogenetics|population genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
