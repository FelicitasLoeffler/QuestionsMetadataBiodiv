Settlement collectors are deployed and rock surfaces cleared at various sites along the pacific coast of California and Oregon. At each site there are at least two types of collectors. Collectors made of plastic mesh, ovoid, pot-scrubbers ("Tuffys") target mussel recruits. Plastic 10x10 cm PVC plates covered with 3M Safety-Walk target barnacle recruitment. 10x10 cm square plots were cleared on the rock near each barnacle recruitment plate to target natural barnacle recruitment. Turfys are rectangles of artificial turf that target crab recruitment. All collectors were deployed and plots cleared in the mid zone at all the sites throughout the year. Additional collectors and plots were added to the low and high shore levels in specific years and sites. Although mussels and barnacles were the main target taxa, other organisms were recorded as well.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ocean|Intertidal Processes|Intertidal Zone|Marine Biology|Marine Plants|Marine Habitat|Biosphere|Aquatic Habitats|Coastal Habitat|Intertidal Data|Intertidal Recruitment Data|Intertidal Coastal recruitment monitoring|PISCO intertidal|PISCO|Temperate Rocky Reef|Intertidal|Recruitment|Percent Cover|Diversity|Abundance|Density|Invertebrate|Algae|Oregon|California|Pacific West Coast|Safety Walk Plate|Tuffy|Rock Plot</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
