Sampling        began in 2005. All data have been interpolated onto a 20 min grid. ADCP data are orgainized        into 1-meter bins, measured as height from the bottom, to a maximum of 20 bins. All bins may        not be filled, and although post processing attempted to exclude data from bins 'above        the surface', users need to exercise caution with the near surface bins. CTD parameters        include Pressure, Temperature, Conductivity, Salinity and Density. The two moored CTD        packages are located approximately 5 and 14 meters above the bottom, and there are up to 5        additional temperature thermistors spaced vertically along the mooring line and 2 bottom        mounted thermistors in the vicinity of the mooring at 10 and 20 meter depth. A bottom        mounted wave-tide meter provides a measure of significant wave height and dominant wave        period at a 2 hour sampling interval.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Moorea Coral Reef|FOR04|LTER|Ocean_biogeochemistry|moorings|Scattering|Conductivity|Ocean Currents|Fluorescence|Density|Pressure|Salinity|Temperature|Water Temperature|Marine|Disturbance|Time Series Program|Bio-Physical Coupling</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
