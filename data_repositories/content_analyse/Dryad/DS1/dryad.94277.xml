Urine protein measurement data of bone marrow only, vehicle treated, and Ibrutinib treated recipients. Column A is an arbitrary identification number given to each mouse. Column B indicates the time-point at which a non-proteinuria event (marked as "0') or a proteinuria event (marked as "1") occurred. Proteinuria event "1" is defined as a mouse showing a &gt;2,000mg/dL score using Albustix urine test strips.Column C indicates the BM only group, Column D indicates mice treated with vehicle. Column E indicates mice treated with Ibrutinib 10mg/kg beginning 7 days post-transplant, Column F indicates mice treated with 10mg/kg Ibrutinib beginning 14 days post-transplant.
