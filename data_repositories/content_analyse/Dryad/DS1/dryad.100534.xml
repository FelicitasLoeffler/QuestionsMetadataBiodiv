This file is a filtered version of the VCF file, including genotype likelihoods for loci with MAF&gt;1%. Additionally, we randomly selected 1 SNP per contig for contigs with multiple variant sites, to ensure independence of SNPs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Burbot|Metapopulation|Genetic structure|Genotyping by sequencing</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
