Data on ptilochronology were yielded through manual measurement of feather growth bar width. Fluctuating asymmetry data consist of two times measurements of feather length which were used to estimate fluctuating asymmetry.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Body condition|nutrition|passerines|phenotypic plasticity|Scaled Mass Index (SMI)</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
