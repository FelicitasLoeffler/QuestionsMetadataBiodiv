The file also contains the latitude and longitude of the centroid of each subcatchment, so the information can be spatially explored.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Marxan with Zones|freshwater focal areas|critical management zones|catchment management zone|connectivity|cost-effectiveness|systematic planning|conservation planning</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
