Sample site descriptors include an assigned number (sortchem), site, date, time, depth, distance, elevation, treatment, date-time,category, and water type (lake, surface, soil). Physical measures collected in the field include temperature (water, soil, well water), conductivity, pH, average thaw depth, well height, discharge, stage height, and light (lakes). Chemical analysis for the sample include alkalinity, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC), inorganic and total dissolved nutrients (NH4, PO4, NO3, TDN, TDP), particulate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (PC, PN, and PP), cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Si), anions (SO4 and Cl), and oxygen. Chlorophyll a was collected at stream sites and for experimental manipulations.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>inorganic nutrients|nutrients|carbon|nitrogen|phosphorus|DOC|dissolved organic carbon|gas|CO2|CH4|DIC|dissolved inorganic carbon|alkalinity|pH|temperature|conductivity|NH4|TDN|TDP|particulates|PP|PC|PN</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
