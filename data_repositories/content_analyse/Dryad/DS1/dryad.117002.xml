For each province, the lower graphs represent the most evolute species and the upper graphs the most involute ones. Only clusters with at least 3 species are considered in these analyses. The black lines are the Ordinary Least-Square linear regressions and the SDD rates are the values of their slopes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Similarity Distance Decay|Pliensbachian|ammonites|biogeography|provincialism|scale effects</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
