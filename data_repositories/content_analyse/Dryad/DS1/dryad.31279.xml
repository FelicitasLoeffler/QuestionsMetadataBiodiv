HYDRO1k provides a suite        of geo-referenced data sets, both raster and vector, which will        be of value for all users who need to organize, evaluate, or        process hydrologic information on a continental scale.        Developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center , the        HYDRO1k project's goal is to provide to users, on a continent by        continent basis, hydrologically correct DEMs along with        ancillary data sets for use in continental and regional scale        modeling and analyses.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>topography|South America|Slope</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
