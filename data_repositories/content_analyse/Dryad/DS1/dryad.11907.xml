The objective of the study was to evaluate whether pine populations at the range edge appear to be expanding in association with fire disturbance. This dataset has been published as: Jill F. Johnstone and F. Stuart Chapin, 2003. Non-equilibrium succession dynamics indicate continued northern migration of lodgepole pine. Global Change Biology, 9(10): 1401-1409. Post-fire seedling count data, made in 2x50m belt transects (all live seedlings/saplings).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>fires|Pinus contorta|Yukon Territory|post-fire regeneration|tree seedlings|burn severity|organic layer|soil pH|soil moisture</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
