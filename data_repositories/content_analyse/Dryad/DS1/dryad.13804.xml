We investigated the relationship between the primary productivity of lake ecosystems and the number of species for lacustrine phytoplankton, rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, macrophytes, and fish. Our study includes two parts: (1) a survey of 33 well-studied lakes for which data on six major taxonomic groups were available, and (2) a comparison of the effects of short- and long-term whole-lake nutrient addition on primary productivity and planktonic species richnessDodson, Stanley I., Shelley E.
