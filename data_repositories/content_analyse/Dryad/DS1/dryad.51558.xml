IL size is proportional to the number of annotated genes harbored in each introgression. Bins, or intervals defined by unique combinations of IL overlap, are indicated with a &#8220;d-&#8221; prefix, indicating &#8220;Davis, CA,&#8221; to avoid confusion with previously designated bins. Regions of the genome not represented in the ILs are indicated by purple bars. Note that ILs can be non-contiguous (indicated by orange or yellow) as well as bins (indicated above graphs with arrowheads and lines). IL9-3-1 posses introgressions on chromosomes 9 and 12, indicated by dashed double arrow. Only chromosomes 7-12 are shown for legibility. Chromosomes 1-6 are depicted in Supplemental Figure 4 online.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>quantitative genetics|morphometrics|leaves|leaf|leaf development|development|stomata|tomato|evolution|adaptation|photosynthesis|fruit|sugar|leaf shape|morphology|QTL|desert|agriculture|plant biology|genomics|transcriptomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
