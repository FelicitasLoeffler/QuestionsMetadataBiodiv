We hypothesized that Prosopis glandulosa growing in these systems would vary considerably in root distribution and maximum rooting depth. The creosote system was expected to be more shallow rooted, and unlike mesquite, the community has been well characterized. The objective of these studies was to examine nematode, microarthropod, micronutrient, and nutrient concentrations at deep and surface soils in the different mesquite communties.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Chihuahuan Desert|Las Cruces|NM|Southwest USA|Dona Ana County|JRN|Jornada Basin LTER|LTER|mesquite|soil cores|deep cores|soil saturation extract|carbon analysis</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
