The data file contains all samples analyzed for this manuscript with the exception of one sample which was determined to be contaminated and removed from the data set (see Supplementary Information document associated with the manuscript for further details). As the AR gene is X-linked, gender data is also provided for each sample.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>somatic mosaicism|androgen receptor|Canada lynx|trinucleotide repeats</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
