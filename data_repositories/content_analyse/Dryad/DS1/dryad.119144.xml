The water chemistry parameters electrical conductivity (EC, log transformed) and turbidity (ntu) are provided as a mean over the four years of sampling. A detection matrix is provided that contains a '1' whenever Litoria raniformis was detected during a survey. 'NA' denotes that a survey was not conducted at that time. A distance matrix includes edge-to-edge distances (metres) between all 33 sites.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bayesian|constructed wetlands|hydroperiod|Litoria raniformis|metapopulation|monitoring|prior information|simulation|site occupancy|water treatment plant</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
