Year 1982 Soil nitrogen</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This experiment was conducted within the fenced areas of  fields A, B, C, and D.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of various nutrients on vegetation.  There were eight different nutrients and a control.  The different nutrients were N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, H2O, and a combination of trace metals.  For details see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutr003.html"&gt;nutrient details&lt;/A&gt;. There were 36 plots in each field, 4 replicates of the 9 treatment levels.  The plots were 1 meter by 4 meters and were  laid out  in a 4 by 9 grid.  The grid was divided into 4  quarters and treatments were assigned with a randomized block design.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
