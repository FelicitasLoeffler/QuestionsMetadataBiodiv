Sites were located within the perimeter of the 1994 burn southeast of Delta Junction Alaska, USA, bordering the Alaska Highway to the North and the Gerstle River to the West. Sites were selected from satellite classifications prepared by Eric Kasischke to represent different levels of burn severity and post-fire vegetation canopy greenness (NDVI). Site selection was constrained by road access, and only areas where all trees had been killed by the fire were selected.At each site, a central point was located in an area of visually homogeneous vegetation. Five parallel transects, each 50 m long, were laid out as follows:1) the first transect started at the central point and followed a randomly-selected compass direction,2) two additional transects were established parallel to the first, but at a random distance from the central transect up to 25 m distant.Vegetation was sampled in a 2-m wide belt centered on each transect, and soil samples were made at intervals along the transect line. Vegetation measurements included:a) basal diameters of all pre-fire trees greater than 1.3 m in height,b) counts of all post-fire tree seedlings, andc) basal diameters of tree seedlings and willows, measured in a randomly chosen 5x2 m portion of each transect.General notes were made on visual percent cover of different vegetation growth forms at the site. Destructive measurements of tree seedlings and willows made in 2001 were used to develop allometric equations to predict dry biomass from basal diameter. Measurements of soil organic layer depth were made at 5 m intervals with the use of a spade to excavate small chunks of sod. At one randomly-selected sample point per transect, a 10x10 cm sample of the organic layer was collected for bulk density measurements. Bulk density samples were dried in a 60&#176;C oven for 48 hours and then weighed. Information on the soil profile to 50-100 cm depth was collected from a single soil pit at the site.The purpose of the study was to document variations in post-fire tree establishment and woody biomass accumulation that could be related to variations in fire severity or pre-fire vegetation characteristics. Data from the study have not yet been published as of 2003.Contains live seedling diameters measured in 2x5 m sub-sections of the transects. Spruce seedlings only.Data in rows.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>post-fire regeneration|transect|spruce</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
