File is in GenePop format. The file has 3 introductory rows: 1) metadata, 2) 15 locus names, 3) 'POP'.  Next is a table of 222 rows x 16 tab-delimited columns. The first column of the table is the identity of the bird.  Adults are identified by the last 5 digits of their Canadian Wildlife Service metal leg band.  Nestlings were too young to band and thus are identified by their nest number and the suffix -Chk (for 'Chick').  The remaining 15 columns are microsatellite genotypes at 15 loci, with the loci ordered according to the names in the second row of the file. Genotypes are 6 digits: two 3-digit numbers, each corresponding to the size (in base pairs) of an allele.  Missing genotypes are represented by a single zero.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>complementarity|high throughput sequencing|mate choice|monophyly|seabird</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
