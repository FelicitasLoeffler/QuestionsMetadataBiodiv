In three independent trials, individual fleas were assessed by qPCR for R. felis infection at day 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post co-feeding. (a) R. felis 17-kDa gene copy number quantities per individual flea lysate were extrapolated based on their position relative to the standard curve. (b) C. felis 18S rRNA gene copy number quantities per individual flea lysate were also determined by extrapolating their values based on their position relative to the standard curve. C. felis 18S rDNA counts were performed for all positive Rf17-kDa fleas. The values in the above tables were log transformed and ratios of logRf17kDa/logCf18SrDNA were generated for individual flea samples (results presented in main text).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Host Parasite Interactions|Insects|Parasitology|Disease Biology</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
