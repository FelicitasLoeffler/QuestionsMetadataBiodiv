We studied probabilistic sex determination in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, which was previously shown to cause evolution of skewed sex ratios. We find that the genetic background alters the sex determination patterns of mat alleles in heterozygotes and that allelic interaction can differentially influence the expression probability of the 7 sexes. We quantify the dominance relationships between several mat alleles and find that A-type alleles, which specify sex I, are indeed recessive to B-type alleles, which are unable to specify that sex. Our results provide additional support for the presence of modifier loci and raise implications for the dynamics of sex ratios in populations of T. thermophila.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>sex determination|ciliate|mating type|inheritance|sex ratio|regulation and transmission|quantitative genetics and Mendelian inheritance|gene action</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
