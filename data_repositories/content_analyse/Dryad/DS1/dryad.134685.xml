Note that RY-coded data are represented by R and Y.  Tree topologies (.trees) used as input are shown: for mitochondrial and combined mitochondrial/nuclear datasets, two topologies were tested, one in which moa/tinamous are sister to the remaining notopalaeognathae, and one where rheas are sister to the remaining notopalaeognathae. For the nuclear dataset, the topology derived from phylogenetic inference on the nuclear data alone was used. MCMCTree control files (.ctl) are not shown as parameters used are described in text.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ancient DNA|biogeography|eggshell|high-throughput sequencing|Palaeognath|phylogeny</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
