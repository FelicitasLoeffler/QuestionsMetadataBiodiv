However, this R script should be sufficient to understand exactly how analyses were performed. Justification for analysis decisions is indicated in the manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>sperm morphology|sperm velocity|form-function relationships</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
