Population analysis measures (Dxy and Da) are performed on a second subset of this file after filtering  genotypes according to allelic depth and genotyping quality with vcftools, with  parameters: --minGQ 30 --minDP 10 --maf 0.001 . This filtered data set is used for figure 2C, and Figure S7.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>domestication|flor yeast|fermentation|Genomics/Proteomics|saccharomyces cerevisiae|Adaptation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
