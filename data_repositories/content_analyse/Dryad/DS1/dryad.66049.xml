Ultrametric tree of Papionini and outgroup taxa as inferred from dataset 2. Tree topologies as inferred from Bayesian (MrBayes) as well as from ML (RAxML) estimations were mainly identical with some exceptions. All unlabelled branches show ML BP of 100% and Bayesian PP of 1.0. Values below are indicated at respective nodes. Taxa indicated with a are arranged differently in the ML (RAxML) and Bayesian tree (MrBayes): ((P. anubis west2, P. anubis west1) P. papio), ((C. torquatus, C. atys), ((C. chrysogaster, M. leucophaeus), M. sphinx)). Red ellipse indicates main difference to figure 1. * = sequences were newly generated in this study.
