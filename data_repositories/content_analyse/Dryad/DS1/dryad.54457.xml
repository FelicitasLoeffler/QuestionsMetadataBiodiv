The data was produced and summarized by Kimura et al. (2002, Molecular Ecology), with haplotype names corresponding to those in Figure 2 of that paper, but the raw data has not previously been presented. This table was produced by Darren Irwin by combining data sources provided by Mari Kimura, Tom Smith, and colleagues. Kimura provided a table of distributions of haplotypes shared by two or more sampling sites, and this was combined with information on the frequency of haplotypes occuring at single locations as inferred from Fig. 2 of Kimura et al. (2002). The table shows mitochondrial control region haplotype names, their restriction digest cutting patterns, their digest group names, and the numbers of birds with each haplotype sampled at each of 13 sites sampled by Kimura et al. (2002). This information has been provided here with the permission of Mari Kimura and Tom Smith, and Kimura et al. (2002) should be cited as the original source.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>migration timing|migratory connectivity|mitochondrial DNA|stable isotopes|stopover ecology|Wilson&#8217;s warblers</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
