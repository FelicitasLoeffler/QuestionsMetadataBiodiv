We measured soil respiration in three replicate pairs of sites (planned burned, control) in two vegetation types (black spruce, mixed hardwoods) using a LiCor 6262 infrared gas analyzer attached to semi-automated chambers (3 replicate chambers per site).  Measurements began in summer 1998 and continued each growing season through 2004, in addition, we measured winter respiration during winter 1998-1999 using a different chamber design on top of the snow pack.  All of the black spruce sites were located on Helmer's Ridge, the mixed hardwood sites initially were located on the east side of the C4 watershed or just outside its eastern boundary.  Following the 1999 fire, all of the mixed hardwood sites were moved burned and unburned areas near the main trail ascending Helmer's Ridge.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>soil respiration|wildfires</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
