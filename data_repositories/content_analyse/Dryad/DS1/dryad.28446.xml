Observations were logged at 30 minute intervals by moored Sea-Bird Electronics MicroCAT 37-SM data loggers and downloaded approximately bimonthly. Salinity, depth and sigma-t were calculated from the measured parameters using standard UNESCO algorithms. This data set was collected as part of the GCE-LTER Project continuous salinity, temperature and water level monitoring program.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|GCE|LTER|mooring|sonde|conductivity|density|depth|hydrography|monitoring|pressure|salinity|temperature|water column|water quality|Inorganic Nutrients</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
