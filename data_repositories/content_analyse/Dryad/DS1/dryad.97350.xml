Vegetative cover in each year (1971 and 2011) was summed across all plots, and proportional change in vegetative cover for each species was calculated as the difference between vegetative cover in 2011 and 1971 weighted by cover in 1971.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>rapid evolution|bumble bees|climate change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
