Oultier Loci</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>Multi-locus SNP data for all individuals of known ecotype and all trawl samples at the 18 outlier loci identified in this study. Data are presented in two-row Structure format, the first column contains sample names, the second column contains a number indicating the treatment (1=stream, 2=shore, 3=trawl), the remaining columns contain genotypes with &#8220;-9&#8221; used to indicate missing data. Sample names use the following convention:-The first two characters indicate either the Stream (St) or Shore (Sh) ecotype.-The second two characters indicate the sample location: Mission Creek (MK), Peachland Creek (PA), Powers Creek (PW), Penticton Creek (PN), Northeast shore (NE), Northwest shore (NW), Southeast shore (SE).-The four characters following the underscore indicate the year that samples were collected (either 2007 or 2010).-The final characters following the hyphen indicate the unique sample ID number for the ecotype, location, and year.-'Tr' is used to indicate samples of unknown ecotype that were collected by trawl.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Life history evolution|RAD sequencing</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
