The SCN population is included as separate file because the large intron does not align well with the intron from these populations. Each sequence indicates the population with the AB, SD, or LJS labels. Sequences labeled with cDNA were sequenced from cDNA while sequences saying clone were sequenced from cloned PCR products from a single individual. The remaining sequences were from direct sequencing of PCR products from a single copepod. The two alleles are given the same label but the second allele is given an 'a' appendage. The phase of the mutations within an individual was not determined experimentally.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Gene duplication|Concerted evolution|Cytoplasmic GOT|Aspartate transaminase</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
