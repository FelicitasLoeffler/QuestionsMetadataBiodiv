Relative to deciduous stands, hemlock stands are depauperate in ant species that are linked to differences in rates of soil turnover and nutrient mineralization between these forest types. In both hemlock and deciduous stands, we will document ant species richness and abundance, assess their role in soil nutrient cycling, determine temporal trajectories of ant community assembly as hemlock declines following woolly adelgid infestation, and is subsequently replaced by birch, and discover how these trajectories influence nutrient availability during this transition.For more details see: Ellison, A.
