Biomass was only calculated for dominant species, including Spartina alterniflora, S. cynosuroides, Juncus roemerianus, and Zizaniopsis miliacea. This data set is based on GCE plant monitoring survey data set PLT-GCEM-0801a, and allometric relationships were based on GCE data sets PLT-GCEM-0211b and PLT-GCEM-0711.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|Juncus roemerianus|Panicum|plants|Scirpus|Spartina alterniflora|Spartina cynosuroides|Typha|Zizaniopsis miliacea|GCE|LTER|biomass|flowering|marshes|monitoring|permanent plots|plant communities|plant cover|plant ecology|primary productivity|shoot height|Primary Production</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
