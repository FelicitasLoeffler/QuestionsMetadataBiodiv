Data are given for collection, type of chase, number of chases, group, %red male category, chases per male, and chase type. Collection refers to the number of days that data were collected for each group, type of chase: either red male or wild-type male chasing a female, number of chases observed is how many chases were observed during the 10 min observation period each day, group is referred to as aquarium in the paper, pctred is the %red male category of which there are five types (25%, 33$, 50%, 66%, and 75%. Chasespermale divides the numbchases by how many males were in the aquarium to allow for comparison of different %red male categories. Chasetype codes typechase numerically (1 = wild-type male chasing female, 2 = red male chasing female).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Life-History Evolution|Selection - Sexual|Models/Simulations|Reproductive Strategies|Fitness|Population Genetics|GMO|Risk Assessment|Trojan Gene</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
