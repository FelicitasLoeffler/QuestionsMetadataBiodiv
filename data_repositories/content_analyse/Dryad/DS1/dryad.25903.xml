The data contained here are for sampling site ARB. Data have been interpolated to a        20 min interval. ADCP data are orgainized into 1.0 meter bins (measured as height from the        bottom) to a maximum of 16 bins. All bins may not be filled, and in some cases, data from        bins technically above the surface are included. VSF data are available at angles, 100, 125        and 150 degrees. CTD parameters include Pressure, Temperature, Conductivity, Salinity,        Density and Fluorescence. The CTD array is located approximately 4.5 meters from the        surface, and there are additional temperature thermistors near the CTD array, at the bottom,        and mid way between these two.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Santa Barbara Coastal|LTER|Ocean_biogeochemistry|moorings|ARB|Temperature|Ocean Currents|Water Temperature|Scattering|Fluorescence|Conductivity|Density|Salinity|Pressure</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
