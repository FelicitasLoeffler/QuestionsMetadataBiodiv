African, Indian and Madagascan taxa used for cichlid dating in the BEAST run have been pruned for analysis of Neotropical taxa. This file is directly readable in the relevant R packages used in the paper. These chronograms were pruned to generate 1000-tree sets for the clades Geophagini, Cichlasomatini and Heroini as needed for analysis presented in the paper.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Phylogenetics|Neotropical cichlids|Time tree</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
