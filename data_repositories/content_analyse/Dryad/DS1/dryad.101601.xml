Data generated in R. Probabilities, consumption rates, and fitnesses are computational approximations of analytical solutions provided in manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>information use|social dominance|resource ecology|decision-making|producer-scrounger dynamics|individual differences</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
