Several perennial life forms, including tree (Juniperand Pinus), shrub (Larrea) and grass (Oryzopsis and Sporobolus), arebeing monitored at 1-3 of four sites which differ in elevation andtopography as well as edaphic and annual precipitationcharacteristics.  The sites represent optimal or marginal/transitionalzones for particular species and permit specific hypotheses to be(e.g., relative impact of wet vs. dry years on C3 {Oryzopsis} vs. C4{Sporobolus} grasses).  Demographic measurements are made biannually,after the 'wet' (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons.  For tree and shrubspecies, estimates of growth and reproduction are based on branchdemography.  Ten replicate branch tips each of 10-20 individuals perspecies per site are monitored.  For Juniper, Pinus and Larrea,vegetative growth of branch as well as reproduction are monitored.Additional measurements include needle length for Pinus and leafproduction, leaf size and branchlet production for Larrea.  ForOryzopsis and Sporobolus, which are both bunch grasses, basaldiameter, leaf length and reproduction are monitored for 100individuals per species per site.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
