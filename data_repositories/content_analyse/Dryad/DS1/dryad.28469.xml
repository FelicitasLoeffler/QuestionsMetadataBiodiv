Samples of water are taken at 2 metre intervals, starting at 1 metre.  Aliquots of that water, proportional to the volume of the stratum each depth represents are combined for the epilimnion, the metalimnion and the hypolimnion for chemical analysis.  The data file PCHPCHEM.TXT contains the raw chemical data for Plastic and Harp lakes. These data are in ASCII format and tab delimited as requested.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Lakes|Zooplankton|Community Dynamics|Population Dynamics|Chemistry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
