We address this issue in a lineage of ray-finned fishes that is well known for its ecological and functional diversity&#8212;African rift lake cichlids. We sequenced ultraconserved elements to generate a phylogenomic tree of the Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi cichlid radiations. We filmed a diverse array of over 50 cichlid species capturing live prey and quantified the extent of jaw kinesis in the premaxillary and maxillary bones. Our combination of phylogenomic and kinematic data reveals a strong association between biting modes of feeding and reduced jaw kinesis, suggesting that the contrasting demands of biting and suction feeding have strongly influenced cranial evolution in both cichlid radiations.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>evolutionary innovation|kinematics|ultraconserved elements|phylogenomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
