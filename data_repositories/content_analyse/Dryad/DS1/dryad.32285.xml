The station was initially instrumented with a standard  8-inch precipitation gauge installed with the rim 1 m above ground.  Measurements were made on an approximately weekly basis. A recording  precipitation gauge was installed at the beginning of January 1965,  with the installation in the clearing positioned so that the gauge rim  subtended an angle of 45 degrees to the tree crowns although the most  effective angle is 30 degrees according to Leaf (1962). Precipitation  was caught in a bucket containing ethylene glycol (to melt snow) and  light oil (to prevent evaporation). As the weight of the bucket  increased, a pen moved up via a spring mechanism and recorded on a  rotating chart. Precipitation was recorded on a continuous basis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|climate|weather|meteorology|precipitation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
