A model of Parvancorina sagitta from Russia with relief increased by 15% was oriented at 90&#176; to the current and was fixed to the lower surface of a half-cylinder. Three-dimensional, incompressible flow of water was simulated with a normal inflow velocity inlet at the upstream end of the half-cylinder and a zero-pressure outlet at the downstream end. Slip boundary conditions were assigned to the top and sides of the half-cylinder, and no-slip boundary conditions were assigned to the Parvancorina model and the lower surface of the half-cylinder. The domain was meshed using free tetrahedral elements and the shear stress transport turbulence model was used to solve the Reynolds-averaged Navier&#8211;Stokes equations. A stationary solver was used to compute the steady-state flow patterns. Simulations were performed with an inlet velocity of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 m/s.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>paleobiology|computational fluid dynamics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
