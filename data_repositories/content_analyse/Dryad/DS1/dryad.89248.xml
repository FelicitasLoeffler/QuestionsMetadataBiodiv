Data include size at emergence and the time required for tail resorption and the production of the first fecal pellet.  The file also contains the number of insect heads egested in each fecal pellet for varying periods of time post-metamorphosis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>compensatory growth|complex life cycle|diet retention time|gut plasticity|intake|latent effects|metamorph|Neotropical treefrog</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
