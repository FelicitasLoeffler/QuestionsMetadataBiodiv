Lines are the different selection lines (either chronic or acute stress selection) and the measured phenotypes are responses to both acute heat and oxidative stress, measured as the number of individuals surviving the stress treatment relative to the number of individuals found in a control treatment that was subjected to the same conditions, but without the stressor.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>G-matrix|experimental evolution|natural selection|phenotypic plasticity|stress resistance|genetic architecture</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
