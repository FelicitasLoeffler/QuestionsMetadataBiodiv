Collections are made at one or two stations in Trout, Sparkling and Crystal lakes. Traps are deployed during the ice-free period for three-week intervals. Mass deposition rates are calculated from the dry-weight of material collected. Material is also analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silica, and selected other constituents.Sampling Frequency: every three weeks during ice-free seasonNumber of sites: 3</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|sediment|sediment deposition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
