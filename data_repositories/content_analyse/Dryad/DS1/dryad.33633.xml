Although central to understanding the evolutionary process, knowledge of the genetic basis of natural variation in genital morphology is limited to a very few species. Using an out-bred cross between phylogenetically distinct lines of Drosophila montana, we characterized quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the size and shape of the distiphallus, a prominent part of the male intromittent organ. Our microsatellite-based linkage analysis shows that intra-specific variation of the distiphallus involves several QTLs of largely additive effect and that a highly significant QTL co-localizes with the same inversion where we have earlier localized a large QTL for a sexually selected courtship song trait. The latter indicates that inversions can play an important role in shaping the evolution of rapidly evolving traits with a potential influence on speciation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Molecular evolution|Morphometrics|Quantitative genetics|Sexual selection &amp; conflicts|Speciation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
