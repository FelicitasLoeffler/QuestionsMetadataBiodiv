Line identifiers are presented in the "patRIL" column, and phenotypes are presented in the "NicotineViability" column. Together with genotype data and analytical R code this file allows users to generate the QTL mapping results presented in Marriage et al. for the B population of DSPR RILs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>DSPR|QTL mapping|nicotine|complex traits</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
