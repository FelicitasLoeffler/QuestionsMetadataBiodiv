They come from sequenced root tips from axenically grown seedlings that were inoculated with mitospores, and then transferred to a growth chamber including other inoculated plants. None of the mitospore phylotypes were recovered from root tips, but three contaminant ectomycorrhizal species were sequenced from the roots. We think they came from water splash during watering of adjacent pots that had been purposely inoculated with Tuber borchii. Identifications were from ITS sequence similarity at 97%.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Environmental sequencing|truffle|mitospore|cryptic diversity|ectomycorrhizal Pezizales</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
