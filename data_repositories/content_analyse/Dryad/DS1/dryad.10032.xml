Data are from Tierberg Karoo Research Centre (TKRC) and the adjacent farm ?Argentina?. Above-ground biomass data were obtained by destructive sampling of 20 plots of 12.5 square meters, 12 plots 4 square meters and one plot 9 square meters in area on TKRC, and 6 plots of 12.5 square meters on Argentina. The package comprises seven data sheets as follows: Worksheet "1.subsample moisture", Worksheet "2.TKRC sp-covmass 1989", Worksheet "3.shrub-vol-mass", Worksheet "4.TKRC 5x2.5plots", Worksheet "5.Arg 5x2.5plots 1991", Worksheet "6.TKRC 3x3plot 1991", Worksheet "7.TKRC 2x2plots 1998"</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Aboveground biomass|vegetation cover-biomass relationship|shrub volume-biomass relationship|moisture content|oven-dry mass</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
