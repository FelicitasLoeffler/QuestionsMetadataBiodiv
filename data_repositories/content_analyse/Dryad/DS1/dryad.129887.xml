Each file contains a single sweep of the radar's antenna, with three variables.  The variable "amplitude" contains 2-D array of radar reflectivities in polar coordinates.  Amplitudes are recorded as 16-bit signed integer values from the digitizer: to convert them to voltages, divide by the variable's "max_counts" metadata value (which is equal to 32764 for all files in this archive).  The other two variables, "pulse_number" and "range", are the values corresponding to the amplitude array's azimuth and radial axes.  Analysis scripts for these files are found in the article's supplementary online information.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>radar|ornithology|seabirds|radar cross-section</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
