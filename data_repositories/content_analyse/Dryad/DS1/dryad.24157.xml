Populations of birds, small mammals and deer were censused. This pilot study, involving only two plots without replications, was intended only to ascertain whether differences exist in animal populations that might relate to herbicide-induced changes in vegetation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>2|4|5-T</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
