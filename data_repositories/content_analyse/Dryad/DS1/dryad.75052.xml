The data files contain information for each patch on the simulated landscape through time. Files contain self explanatory column headings. Data used and presented in the paper are contained in the folders named, 'mut_load_10.10' and 'varying_static_K'. Other folders contain data used to test the effect of selfing and back mutations in the simulations. These data were used to answer referee questions but were not presented or discussed in the results.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Mutation load|Range formation|Dispersal|Environmental gradients</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
