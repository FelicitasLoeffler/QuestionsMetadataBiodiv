Year 1987 Soil ammonium</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>The purpose of this experiment, begun in 1983 by Johannes Knops, is to determine what effect different fire frequencies have on grassland vegetation. This experiment is being conducted in field B. There are 4 different burn treatments:1) plots burned every year2) plots burned every other year3) controls which are not burned4) plots burned every fourth yearThere are 6 replicates of each treatment which were randomly assigned to the 24 plots. Plots are 8 by 8 meters and are placed in a 3 by 8 grid with 2 meter walkways. Plots are marked with colored rebar at each corner.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
