However, most studies of lncRNA gene regulation have been performed using model animal species, and very little is known about this type of gene regulation in non-bilaterians. We have therefore analyzed RNA-Seq data derived from a comprehensive set of embryogenesis stages in the calcareous sponge Sycon ciliatum and identified hundreds of developmentally expressed intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) in this species. In situ hybridization of selected lincRNAs revealed dynamic spatial and temporal expression during embryonic development. More than 600 lincRNAs constitute integral parts of differentially expressed gene modules, which also contain known developmental regulatory genes, e.g. transcription factors and signaling molecules. This study provides insight into the non-coding gene repertoire of one of the earliest evolved animal lineages, and suggests that RNA-based gene regulation was likely present in the last common ancestor of animals.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>lncRNA|Sponges|Development|Animal evolution</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
