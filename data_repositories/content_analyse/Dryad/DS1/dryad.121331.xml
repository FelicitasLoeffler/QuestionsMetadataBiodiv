Scrubbed names represent records from the taxonomic name resolution service (TNRS). Citations for each source are provided in the main manuscript. Published records that contained mutiple observations are indicated by multiple state identifiers (i.e., AM AM EM).                          Table A2: Species level list of mycorrhizal states derived from Table A1.                                                                            Table A3: For those species that matched the Zanne et al. (2013) phylogeny, the number of literature observations for the state of each species is indicated, along with the consensus state used in the analysis.Table A4: The final list of species matched with the phylogeny, along with the consensus mycorrhizal state.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
