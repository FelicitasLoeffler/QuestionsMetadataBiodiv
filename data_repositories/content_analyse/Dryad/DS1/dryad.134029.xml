The addition of a cognitive task increases arm swing asymmetry during walking, but the characteristics and mechanism of this asymmetry are unclear. We hypothesized that this effect is lateralized and a Stroop word-colour naming task&#8212;primarily involving left hemisphere structures&#8212;would reduce right arm swing only. We recorded gait in 83 healthy subjects aged 18&#8211;80 walking normally on a treadmill and while performing a congruent and incongruent Stroop task. The primary measure of arm swing asymmetry&#8212;an index based on both three-dimensional wrist trajectories in which positive values indicate proportionally smaller movements on the right&#8212;increased significantly under dual-task conditions in those aged 40&#8211;59 and further still in the over-60s, driven by reduced right arm flexion. Right arm swing attenuation appears to be the norm in humans performing a locomotor-cognitive dual-task, confirming a prominent role of the brain in locomotor behaviour. Women under 60 are surprisingly resistant to this effect, revealing unexpected gender differences atop the hierarchical chain of locomotor control.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>arm swing|central pattern generator|dual-task|cognitive control|gender|motor control</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
