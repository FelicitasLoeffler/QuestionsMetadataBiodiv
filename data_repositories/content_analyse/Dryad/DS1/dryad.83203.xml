For all soils, we measured fungal community composition For each plant, we recorded biomass, chemistry (amino acids and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) in phloem exudates), performance of a specialist and a generalist aphidBiomass and chemistry were measured at 2 sampling times: 6 and 13 weeks after transplanting in the conditioned soils</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Amino acids|Aphid|Plant-soil (below-ground) interactions|Pyrrolizidine alkaloids|Soil fungal community</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
