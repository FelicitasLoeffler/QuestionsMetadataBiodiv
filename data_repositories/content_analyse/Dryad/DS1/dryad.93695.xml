The method used to create VLUIS is significantly different to traditional methods used to create land use information and has been designed to create regular and consistent data over time. It covers the entire landmass of Victoria and separately describes the land tenure, land use and land cover for each cadastral parcel across the state, biennially for land tenure and use and annually for land cover, for each year from 2006 to 2013. The data is in the form of a shapefile.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>land use|land tenure|land cover|GIS</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
