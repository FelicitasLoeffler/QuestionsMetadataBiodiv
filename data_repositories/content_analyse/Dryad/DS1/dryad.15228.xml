Desertification is hypothesized to have altered the spatial and temporal availability of resources required by the biota. Results of desertification on the Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes. We hypothesize that these shifts in vegetation have changed resources temporally for many of the consumers. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags, but shrub systems do not, then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition, shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have hypothesized that consumer populations, diversity, and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands. Diversity and/or densities are hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in order to provide data to test these hypotheses. Methods and locations. Pitfall trap grids have been installed at three creosotebush sites, three grassland sites, three mesquite sites, and two tarbush sites. Each grid consists of four by five rows of traps at 10 meter intervals. A mammal live-trap is placed next to each pitfall trap. Traps are opened for one week in the late spring and one week in the late summer. Small mammals are removed from the traps and assigned individual numbers by removing a single digit from each foot. Species, sex, and measurement data are taken for each animal.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Chihuahuan Desert|Las Cruces|NM|Southwest USA|Dona Ana County|JRN|Jornada Basin LTER|LTER|animals|consumers|populations|small mammals</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
