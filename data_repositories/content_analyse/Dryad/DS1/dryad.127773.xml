We demonstrate that high-throughput sequencing of seawater environmental DNA can provide useful estimates of genetic diversity in a whale shark (Rhincodon&#8201;typus) aggregation. We recover similar mitochondrial haplotype frequencies in seawater compared to tissue samples, reliably placing the studied aggregation in a global genetic context and expanding the applications of environmental DNA to encompass population genetics of aquatic organisms.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Environmental DNA|Whale shark|Population genetics|High-throughput sequencing</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
