The trait scoring follows the fuzzy coding procedure as described in the manuscript. Species names are abbreviated by the first three letters of their genus. The functional traits are sorted by number (1-9) and followed by their trait-categories. See the "Abbreviations species and traits. csv" file below and the manuscript for details.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>functional traits|functional diversity|functional dispersion|zoobenthos|benthic communities</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
