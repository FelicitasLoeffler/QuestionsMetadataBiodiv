Year 1993 Percent cover data</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This experiment was established in field D in August of 1991.  There are 30, 2m x 2m plots.  These plots are in prairie openings in unmanipulated natural vegetation.  They were placed in a haphazard manner, being about 20m apart within an opening.  Each plot was divided into 16, 0.5m x 0.5m subplots.  Percent cover estimates of vegetation are done in September for each of the sixteen subplots in each of the 30 plots.	In the month of June 1992, each of the 30 plots were divided into 4 sections.  Seeds of a combination of various species were added to two sections.  The other remaining two sections were used as controls.  There are 10 treatments in this experiment.  Each treatment consists of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 54 species randolmly pooled from a total of 54 species.  Each treatment is replicated six times.  These are true replicates of the number of species added but not of the species composition.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts. &lt;! in file trmte93.&gt;Because of the immense size of this treatment file, it has been broken down by plot number.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
