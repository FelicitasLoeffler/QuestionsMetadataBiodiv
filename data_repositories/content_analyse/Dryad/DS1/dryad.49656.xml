The main commands are at the top.  Select the Secretary-Genechart.input.csv as stoat.dat.  Read in this R code using source(file.choose()).  Plot the chart using the command:  chart.func(stoat.dat, refpopnames=c("Mainland", "y2005"), include.pops=c("y2006", "y2007", "y2008","y2009")) title(main="...").  This code will then produce a GeneChart assignment using the Mainland and Secretary Island 2005 captures as reference populations, and attempt to assign subsequent Secretary Island captures (from 2006 - 2009) onto this chart. The reference populations and additional included populations can be modified in the command.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Invasive Species|Assignment|Immigration|Connectivity|Mustela erminea|Microsatellite</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
