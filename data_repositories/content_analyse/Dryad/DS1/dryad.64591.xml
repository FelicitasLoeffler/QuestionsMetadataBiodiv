It includes the nine chloroplast regions and ITS sampled for the 113 taxa as well as all gene regions assembled from plastid sequencing for 22 Viburnum taxa. The plastid coding, non-coding, and ITS partitions have been identified as character sets at the end of the file. Please refer to other data file submissions associated with this paper to retrieve individual gene regions. These data were used to generate the phylogenies associated with Figure 2.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>character evolution|chloroplast DNA|plastid genome|classification|phylogeny|phylogenetic definitions|phylogenetic nomenclature</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
