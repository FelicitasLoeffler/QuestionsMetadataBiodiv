An important case in point is that of the 150+ species of Triatominae, vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease across the Americas. We present a fully automated system that is able to identify triatomine bugs from Mexico and Brazil with an accuracy consistently above 80%, and with considerable potential for further improvement. The system processes digital photographs from a photo apparatus into landmarks, and uses ratios of measurements among those landmarks, as well as (in a preliminary exploration) two measurements that approximate aspects of coloration, as the basis for classification. This project has thus produced a working prototype that achieves reasonably robust correct identification rates, although many more developments can and will be added, and&#8212;more broadly&#8212;the project illustrates the value of multidisciplinary collaborations in resolving difficult and complex challenges.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>automation|identification|image processing|Chagas disease</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
