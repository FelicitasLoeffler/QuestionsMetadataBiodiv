Haplo-diploid parthenogens in which parthenogenesis is due to genetic causes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This dataset is haplo-diploid parthenogens in which parthenogenesis is due to genetic causes, and where the cellular mechanisms underlying parthenogenesis are studied (all species except the last one in the list are hymenopterans. Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis is a thrips species). These include information on species name and the cellular mechanism for parthenogenesis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>endosymbionts|infectious parthenogenesis|thelytoky|bacteria|gamete duplication|haplo-diploid sex determination</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
