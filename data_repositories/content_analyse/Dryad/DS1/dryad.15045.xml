These districts are a form of special purpose district created by the state of  Wisconsin in the early 1970s to address the specific problems of lake mangement not being  addressed by existing governmental capacities. These districts are by statute granted the  authority to levy property taxes, special assessments, special charges and delinquent charges  against property owners within their geographic boundaries. This fund-raising authority gives  to lake districts a capacity not only to raise substantial funds but to do so consistently over  time, thereby alloting to them a practical capacity not readily available to other groups (such  as lake associations) involved in lake management. Data are from years 1992 - 1996.Sampling Frequency: annuallyNumber of sites: 190</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|lake district revenue</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
