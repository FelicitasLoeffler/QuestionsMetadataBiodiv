It adds two columns (genotype and line number) at the beginning of each csv file listed in column 1 of an input file. The input file is a csv file. The first row of the input file is considered as a header row. The script also removes the term "mapping" from the chromosome names.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>clonality|clonal diversity|invasive species|Poaceae|SNP molecular markers</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
