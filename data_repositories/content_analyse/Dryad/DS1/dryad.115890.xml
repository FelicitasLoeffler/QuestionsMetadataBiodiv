In the experimental demonstration, E1 lifts up the single tube and tapes it with her hand to show it is empty, and then places it on the ground with the openings perpendicular to the monkey&#8217;s perspective She then picks up a fake fruit with her left hand and appears to place this fruit on the side opening (baiting hand and side was counterbalanced across monkeys). She then picks up the occluder and walks away so that the monkey can approach, in the real study she moved behind the camera person (E2). In the example response clip, the monkey approaches and looks in the left side. Note that orientation of video switches: in the demonstration it shows the monkey&#8217;s perspective, whereas in the example test clip E2 is behind E1 while she does the demonstration.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>metacognition|comparative psychology|information seeking|knowledge</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
