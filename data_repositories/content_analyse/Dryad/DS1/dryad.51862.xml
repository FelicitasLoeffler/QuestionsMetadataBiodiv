Sequences are not aligned globally but beetle variants are aligned to each plant reference. The description section of each fasta sequence explains whether a beetle derived sequence was identified by comparison to a reference sequence or using SAP.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Insects|Natural Selection and Contemporary Evolution|Phylogeography|Population Genetics - Empirical|Species Interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
