For data analyses, thresholds were determined visually as the sound intensity at which neuronal activity was seen in response to at least four of the five stimulus repetitions. For averaging threshold, sound pressure level data were transferred to sound pressure (rel. 20 &#956;Pa) and thereafter transformed back to dB SPL for visualization.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>auditory system|hearing threshold|frequency tuning|evolution of sensory system</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
