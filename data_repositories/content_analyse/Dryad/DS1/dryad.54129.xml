The aphids used in this experiment either contained no known secondary symbionts or were artificially infected with different complements of symbiont species.  Groups of 20 aphids, representing one of five genotypes and hosting one of seven symbiont complements, were exposed to spores of the pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis. After six days all aphids were scored as a) sporulating, b) dead but not sporulating, or c) alive. In the spreadsheet, each row represents a replicate with 20 aphids. Columns are as follows: &gt;&gt;&gt;Species - Aphid species, two levels (A. pisum, S. avenae). &gt;&gt;&gt;Gen - Aphid genotype, five levels (145, J68, J102, Co23, Co26)&gt;&gt;&gt;Sym - Symbiont infection status. Ha / Ri / Sp represent Hamiltonella defensa, Rickettsia sp. or Spiroplasma sp., and the value after underscore represents the genotype of original pea aphid host. &gt;&gt;&gt;Fung_D6 - The number of aphids in a replicate which were classified as sporulating six days after the exposure. &gt;&gt;&gt;Dead_D6 - The number of aphids in a replicate which were classified as dead but not sporulating. &gt;&gt;&gt;Alive_D6 - The number of aphids in a replicate which were alive six days after the exposure. &gt;&gt;&gt;Total - The total number of aphids in the three previous categories. Note that in some cases the total is different than 20 &#8211; occasionally not all aphids were found six days after the exposure, or the number of the exposed aphids in a replicate may have been miscalculated by 1 or 2.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Evolution of co-operation|Host-parasite interaction|Insects|Microbes|Symbiosis</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
