On Trout Lake four additional sites are sampled, where depths are approximately at 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, and 25 m respectively, with three tows done at each site. All samples are taken in darkness. Samples are preserved and counted, yielding numbers caught. Derived data include the mean and standard deviation of the number of each species captured as well as the mean and standard deviation of the density of individuals on both an areal and volumetric basis. These night tows target the large invertebrate planktivore component of the pelagic zooplankton community.Sampling Frequency: annuallyNumber of sites: 11</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|pelagic macroinvertebrates|pelagic|macroinvertebrates|chaoborus|leptodora|mysis|species abundance</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
