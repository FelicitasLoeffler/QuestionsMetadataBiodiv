We observed colonies where (1) all fertile workers were policed, (2) all fertile workers were not policed and continued reproduction, (3) all fertile workers were not policed but self-restrained from reproduction, and (4) mixture of policing, continued worker reproduction and self-restraint took place.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Behavior: dominance|Behavior: reproductive|Behavior: social|Conflict|Ecology: behavioral|Evolution: social|Kin: conflict|ants|social</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
