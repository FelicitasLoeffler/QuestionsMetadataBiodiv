Most parameters are measured at or close to the deepest part of the lake. Chlorophyll is measured by collecting separate integrated samples from the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnionSampling Frequency: generally monthly for one summer, for some lakes, one or two samples in one summerNumber of sites: 51</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|chlorophyll|phaeophyton|chlorophyll a</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
