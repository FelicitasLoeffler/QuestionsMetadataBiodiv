In this paper, we experimentally test for evidence of fine-scale local adaptation in juvenile survival and growth among three populations of an invasive freshwater fish with reciprocal transplants and common-garden experiments. Despite intrinsic differences in habitat quality, in two out of three populations we detected evidence of increased survival in &#8216;home&#8217; vs. &#8216;away&#8217; environments with a Bayesian occupancy model fitted to mark-recapture data. We found support for the &#8216;local vs. foreign&#8217; criterion of local adaptation as 14 out of 15 pairwise comparisons of performance were consistent with local adaptation (p &lt; 0.001). Patterns in growth were less clear, though we detected evidence of location and population-level effects. Although the agents of divergent ecological selection are not known in this system, our results combine to indicate that adaptive divergence &#8211; reflected by higher relative survival of local individuals &#8211; can occur in a small number of generations and only a few kilometers apart on the landscape.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Local adaptation|contemporary evolution|invasive species|reciprocal transplant|immigrant inviability</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
