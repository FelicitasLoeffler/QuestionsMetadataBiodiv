Tip labels represent either specimen numbers and/or host species (in the genera Flueggea, Phyllanthus, Breynia, and Glochidion) from which specimens were reared, and are from the present study as well as Kawakita et al. (2004) Evolution, Kawakita et al. (2009) Proc. R. Soc. B, and Hembry et al. (2013) Proc. Roy. Soc. B. Many tip labels follow the Supplementary Appendix in Hembry et al. (2013) Proc. R. Soc. B. For E. lanceolaria OTUs, numbers refer to particular specimens, two-letter codes indicate collection localities (GB: Gaobangshan, LD: South China Botanical Garden, QA: Qiao Island, WT: Wutongshan), C = pupa with cocoon, NC = pupa with no cocoon. This tree was used in Shimodaira-Hasegawa tests as described in the present manuscript.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Coevolution|Interactions: mutualism|Interactions: plant/insect|Interactions: symbiosis|Phylogeny|Insect|Plant</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
