The data from each experimental group (larvae from either northern or southern localities infected with parasitoids of different origin) of the two species are shown in separate excel sheets named accordingly. The tables include image file names, date for the parasitism experiments, identification data for each sample, geographic origin of the beetles, the raw hemocyte counts subdivided into hemocyte classes and the calculated percentages. On average 700 hemocytes from 9 images were counted per individual.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Asecodes|Cellular defence|Ecological immunology|Galerucella|Host-pathogen evolution|Host-parasitoid interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
