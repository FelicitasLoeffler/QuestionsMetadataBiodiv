Fin shape and large white horizontal scratches on side of dorsal fin (orange ellipse) fade but remain constant. Scratches on body (red ellipse) fade with progression through time, but are still evident in each photograph. S1A and S1B from June 2011, S1C from July 2012, S1D from June 2013. In 2012 the individual picked up a nick in the trailing edge of its fin (S1C) This nick was different to that seen in the anomalous photograph (Figure 1A) from 2011 but it remained consistent when this animal was re-sighted again in 2013 (S1D).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Photographic-identification|Bottlenose dolphins|Permanent mark</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
