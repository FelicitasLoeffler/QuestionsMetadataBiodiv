Included are counts of beetles caught by identical traps in two settings: traps within the MESOCLOSURES and traps outside the MESOCLOSURES. The specific columns are the following: Time: day of experiment (with individual trapping periods extending over 24 hours)Size: the dimension of the MESOCLOSURE (given as the length of MESOCLOSURE side, in metres)Replicate: the identity of the replicate cageTotal: the summed number of beetles caught inside and outside of the MESOCLOSUREInside: the number of beetles caught inside of the MESOCLOSURE</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biodiversity-ecosystem functioning|dung beetles|ecosystem services|enclosures|experimental manipulations|functional groups|grazing pressure|mesocosms</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
