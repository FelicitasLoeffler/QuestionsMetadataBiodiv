Optical topographic surveys were performed to      produce a layout of the area studied. This file provides the northing, easting, and orthogonal      height information for the gage boxes, flumes and rebars set up for Andersen, House, Canada,      Delta and Green Creek. NOTE: These points were omitted from the plot files for the individual sites       ( found in the Stream Transect Coordinate List file), since in most cases they fall outside the map area.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
