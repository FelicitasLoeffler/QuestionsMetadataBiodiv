The reference contains 78,519 transcripts that represent the longest subcomponent of each subcomponent isogroup from the Trinity assembly. The raw reads used for the Trinity assembly are described in the following publication: Vidal-Dupiol J, Zoccola D, Tambutt&#233; E, et al. (2013) Genes related to ion-transport and energy production are upregulated in response to CO 2-driven pH decrease in corals: new insights from transcriptome analysis.
