K., Ecology and Evolution, 2015. Data includes butterfly flight metabolic rate data, butterfly body temperature data measured in semi-natural conditions (on two occasions for each individual, denoted by flight1 and flight2), data on environmental conditions during body temperature measurements, and genotype data at candidate gene loci. Experiments were made with field-collected, common garden-reared Glanville fritillary (Melitaea cinxia) butterflies.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>butterfly flight|insect flight|dispersal evolution|dispersal modeling|thermal tolerance|thermoregulation|sex difference|Pgi|Flightin</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
