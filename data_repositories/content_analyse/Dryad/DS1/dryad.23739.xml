Transects were laid out across the 5 mammal trapping webs using the rebar along the spokes from 50 to 60 and from 122 to 132. Repeat measures of the same bushes are performed seasonally. The Point-quarter method is also used on the burned and unburned plots of the mixed shrub site. Whole shrubs of various size classes are collected and sorted and weighed to develop regressions for biomass.  This is done for both burned and unburned shrubs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>SEV|Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge|New Mexico|ANPP|Shrub density|burn|unburned|LTER|shrubland|Larrea tridentata</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
