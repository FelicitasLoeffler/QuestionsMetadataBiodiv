The subspecies-x-island occurrences file differs from the species-x-island file in that in the former, subspecies are treated the same as other species (they have their own line in the incidence matrix), while in the latter, all subspecies are aggregated into their parent species.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>island biogeography|hierarchical Bayes|dispersal|occupancy model|species-area curve|birds</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
