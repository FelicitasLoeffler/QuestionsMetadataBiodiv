The ReadMe.csv file contains the unique 8 bp barcodes and individual identifiers used in each of the 5 files. Each individual is indicated by its two-letter state code and number. Additional birds that were sequenced in the files, but not used in this study are indicated by "not used".</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>cytokines|genetic drift|genetic variation|immune genes|local adaptation|mediating genes|MHC|population differentiation|selection</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
