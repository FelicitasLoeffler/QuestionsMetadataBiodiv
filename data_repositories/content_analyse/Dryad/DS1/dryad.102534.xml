Only those pixels with forest of height greater or equal to 20m in 2007 were included. The maximum AGB estimated per pixel is 236.5 Mg ha^-1. The minimum per pixel biomass is 0 Mg ha^-1. The projection is UTM48S. The pixel size is ~100m x 100m.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Climate change|deforestation|carbon stocks|carbon emissions|above ground biomass</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
