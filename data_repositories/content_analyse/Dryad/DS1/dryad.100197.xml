Climate data was obtained from BioClim. Columns: Country: Norway or Sweden. OakID: Unique tree identifier number. UTM33_X and UTM33_Y: co-ordinates for each tree location in UTM33. Circumference: Girth of the tree at breast height. Openness: Openness of tree canopy (see paper for description). MeanTempWarmestQuart - mean temperature during the warmest quarter of the year. MeanPrecipWarmestQuart - mean precipitation during the warmest quarter of the year. NorthernSpecialist - OtherGeneralist: species richness counts per tree.
