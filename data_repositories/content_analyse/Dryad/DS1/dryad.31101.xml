Our study supports this and additionally the notion that monitoring of small mammaldiversity can be used as a quick and inexpensive indicator of ecosystem integrity. The movementof herbivores to and from waterholes results in an increasing gradient in their grazing, browsing andtrampling impacts towards waterholes, creating circular zones of impact known as piospheres. Anincrease in artificial waterholes in the past has resulted in an overlap in these impacted areas,creating a homogenised, disturbed habitat. The aim of our study was to determine if the vegetationstructure and composition is indeed impacted in the piosphere and whether this affects rodentdiversity and abundance. We tested an open waterhole and one which had been closed for abouttwo years. We found similar number of rodents at both waterholes. However the open waterholehad a lower diversity of rodents than the closed waterhole and was dominated by the multimammatemouse, Mastomys natalensis, which in other studies has been associated with disturbed areas.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Kruger National Park|South Africa</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
