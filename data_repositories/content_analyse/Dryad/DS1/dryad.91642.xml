DICOM is a standard format for MRI images, and these can be analyzed with software packages such as BrainVoyager (Brain Innovation, The Netherlands), which we have used in the paper, or an open-access software package such as FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). The analysis procedure for the fMRI data is fully described in the Methods section of the paper. DICOM files are available for each subject pre- and post-exposure, for each of the two tasks presented in the paper (finger tapping and mental rotation).
