These transects extended one radius into the surrounding forest.  This study was designed to determine if carbon cycling within these gaps were different from those in the soils of surrounding undisturbed forests.  If there were differences, she wanted to determine what sized gap was required to show an effect.  These transects were divided into four zones.  Two zones were north of the E-W centerline, one in and one out of the gap.  The other two zones were south of the E-W centerline, one in and one out of the gap.Soil moisture and temperature were both higher in the gap than in the surrounding forest but SOM, lab respiration and litter depth were both lower in the gap than in the forest.  These results suggest that either litter input is lower in the gap than in the surrounding forest and/or that the decomposition rates are lower in the gap.  Except for the smallest gap, soil moisture was lower and temperature higher in the northern half of the gap.  In the 50 m gaps, laboratory respiration rates, litter depth, and SOM were higher in the southern portion of the gap as were total carbon values.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Forest soil fertility|Forest soils|Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER)|Tree-fall gaps|Inorganic fluxes</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
