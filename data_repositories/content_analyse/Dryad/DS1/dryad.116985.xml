Ecological Group (EG) for each taxa according AMBI is detailed and number of reads transformed into relative proportions shown. Presence/absence of taxa found using traditional identification at each station is represented by x.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Illumina MiSeq|COI barcodes|extracellular DNA|AMBI|biotic indices|macroinvertebrates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
