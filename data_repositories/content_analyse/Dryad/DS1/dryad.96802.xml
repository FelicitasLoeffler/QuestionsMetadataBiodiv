Here we demonstrate that the dynamics of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) signalling and the cell cycle are prioritised differently depending on the timing of an inflammatory signal. Using iterative experimental and computational analyses, we show physical and functional interactions between NF-&#954;B and the E2 Factor 1 (E2F-1) and E2 Factor 4 (E2F-4) cell cycle regulators. These interactions modulate the NF-&#954;B response. In S-phase, the NF-&#954;B response was delayed or repressed, while cell cycle progression was unimpeded. By contrast, activation of NF-&#954;B at the G1/S boundary resulted in a longer cell cycle and more synchronous initial NF-&#954;B responses between cells. These data identify new mechanisms by which the cellular response to stress is differentially controlled at different stages of the cell cycle.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
