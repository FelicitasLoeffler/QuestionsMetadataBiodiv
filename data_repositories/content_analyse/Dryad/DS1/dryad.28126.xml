Vegetation structure provides cover from predators and harsh abiotic conditions.  Plant species composition affects the types of seeds and herbaceous material available to granivores and herbivores, and influences arthropod populations, which are important prey for the omnivorous species that dominate in shortgrass steppe.  Both vegetation structure and plant community composition are sensitive to the availability of precipitation as well as the activity of large mammalian herbivores. In 1999, we began measuring vegetation structure and plant community composition on the three grassland and three shrubland trapping webs where we live-trap small mammals.  Vegetation measurements are made once each year, usually in mid-July.  Percent canopy cover of each plant species was estimated visually in 30 0.25-m2 Daubenmire quadrats on each web.  To estimate habitat structure, we measured the height of grass, forb and shrub plants adjacent to each quadrat, the density of half-shrubs, small mammal mounds and burrows, harvester ant mounds and the dimensions of large shrubs and animal mounds.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>plants|cover|vegetation structure|mammals|population dynamics|community dynamics|rodents|grasslands|shrublands</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
