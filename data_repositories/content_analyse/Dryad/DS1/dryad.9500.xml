One-inch diameter PVC  poles were driven into the snowpack to form vertical transects within  each couloir. The height difference (cm) between the top of each pole  and the snow surface was recorded. On the subsequent visit the new  height difference was recorded and the pole driven into the snow and  the reset height was recorded. Poles in a given transect were  relocated as necessary during the course of the season.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|ablation rate|mean ablation|meltout|snow|snowdepth</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
