JAKMIP is one of the gene families that was identified as a neighbouring gene family to the PDE6 catalytic subunit gene family. The tree was made using the PhyML implementation in the Seaview 4.5.3 program.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>PhyML|JAKMIP|vertebrates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
