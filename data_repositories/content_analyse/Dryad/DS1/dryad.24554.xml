The data was gathered from records from the City Council since 1930 relating to decisions concerning land-uses considered to be environmental disamentities.  Each appeal identified as an environmental disamentity was divided into one of six environmental disamentity issues: incinerator, recycling facility, penal/correctional facility, garage/open parking lot, 100+ housing unites, and other environmental impacts.  Each appeal has an associated Appeal_number and also an Ordinance_ID, which was used to label the appeals placed on the Ordinance_point layer.  Along with one of the six issues listed for each appeal, there is a more detailed disamentity_type description.  If the appeal was unable to placed on the Ordinance_point layer, it received a "1" in the unmatched field, otherwise a "0" if placed.  This table can be joined to the Ordinance_point data layer using the "Ordinance_point_relationship" and the field "Ordinance_ID".  This table can also be joined to the Ordinance_unmatched data table using the "Ordinance_unmatched_relationship" and the field "Ordinance_ID".</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Baltimore|MSA|Maryland</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
