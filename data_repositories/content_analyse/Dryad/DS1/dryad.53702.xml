We used line-cross analysis to dissect the genetic architecture of divergence between two plant species that exhibit Haldane&#8217;s rule for male sterility and rarity, Silene latifolia and Silene diclinis. We made 15 types of crosses, including reciprocal F1, F2, backcrosses, and later-generation crosses, grew the seeds to flowering, and measured the number of viable ovules, proportion of viable pollen, and sex ratio. Typically, Haldane&#8217;s rule for male rarity in XY animal hybrids is explained by interactions involving recessive X-linked alleles that are deleterious when hemizygous (dominance theory), while sterility is explained by rapid evolution of spermatogenesis genes (faster-male evolution). In contrast, we found that the genetic mechanisms underlying Haldane&#8217;s rule between the two Silene species did not follow these conventions. Dominance theory was sufficient to explain male sterility, but male rarity likely involved faster-male evolution. We also found an effect of the neo-sex chromosomes of S. diclinis on the extreme rarity of some hybrid males. Our findings suggest that the genetic architecture of Haldane&#8217;s rule in dioecious plants may differ from those commonly found in animals.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Reproductive Isolation|Hybridization|Quantitative Genetics|Speciation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
