Samples were genotyped at 10 microsatellite loci (PpSSR012, PpSSR014, PpSSR018, PpSSR022, PpSSR087, PpSSR102, PpSSR146, PpSSR161, PpSSR178, and PpSSR195) using genomic DNA extracted directly from each pustule following a modified CTAB-based protocol. Fragment analysis was via capillary electrophoresis using an ABI 3700 DNA automated sequencer. Positive and negative controls were included for each locus scored and scoring was repeated for representative alleles for each locus to ensure the accuracy of genotyping. Allele sizes were estimated using marker standards (ROX Geneflo 625, CHIMERx, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and scored using ABI PeakScanner Analysis Software v1.0.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Population Genetics - Empirical|Invasive Species|Host Parasite Interactions|Fungi|host jump|emerging disease</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
