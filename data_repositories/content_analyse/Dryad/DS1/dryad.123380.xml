Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence &#8211; baboons&#8217; preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed &#8211; is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop&#8217;s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>habitat|imagery|point cloud|map|remote sensing</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
