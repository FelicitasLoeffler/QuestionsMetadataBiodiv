Next are species residual phenotypic variance covariance matrices for which the effects of sex and locality were removed (see table S1 of article). The last data is a data frame that was used as entry on the function oubm.fit of the slouch R package.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>evolutionary potential|lines of least evolutionary resistance|Rhinella granulosa species group|selection gradients|G-matrix</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
