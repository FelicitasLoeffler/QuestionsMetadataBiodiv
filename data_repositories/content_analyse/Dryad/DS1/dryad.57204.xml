Data available in the Sequence Read Archive from the maize inbred line B73 included 30 RNA-seq experiments from 13 distinct tissues (leaf, immature ear, immature tassel, seed, endosperm, embryo, embryo sac, anther, ovule, pollen, silk, and root and shoot apical meristem) encompassing a total of 1.168 billion reads with read lengths ranging from 35 to 110 nucleotides. Maize ESTs from a vast variety of tissues and stages were also collected from GenBank and integrated with the maize B73 genome annotation (AGP v2).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>long noncoding RNAs|RNA based sequencing (RNA-seq)|expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)|maize</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
