Yet, plant lincRNAs remain poorly characterized and how lincRNA biogenesis is regulated is unclear. Using a reproducibility-based bioinformatics strategy to analyze 200 Arabidopsis transcriptome datasets, we identified 13,230 intergenic transcripts of which 6,480 can be classified as lincRNAs. Expression of 2,708 lincRNAs was detected by RNA-seq experiments. Transcriptome profiling by custom microarrays revealed that the majority of these lincRNAs are expressed at a level between those of mRNAs and pri-miRNAs. A subset of lincRNA genes show organ-specific expression whereas others are responsive to biotic and/or abiotic stresses. Further analysis of transcriptome data in 11 mutants uncovered SERRATE, CBP20, and CBP80 as regulators of lincRNA expression and biogenesis. RT-PCR experiments confirmed these 3 proteins are also needed for splicing of a small group of intron-containing lincRNAs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Noncoding RNA|lincRNA|transcriptome|RNA-seq</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
