Hooked thorns, straight spines and various branching architecturesare used to defend against herbivory. The defenses of four Acacia species are quantified using astripping index, biting index and branching index, which are combined in an overall defensiveindex. Three feeding simulations were also performed in an effort to quantify the effect of Acaciadefenses on browsers in a more holistic manner. Results showed the biting index and clamp tests tobe a good measure for the effectiveness of spines. The sock test, stripping index and branchingindex appear to be useful tools for assessing the defensive functioning of hooks, and the associatedimportance of architecture. This study provides a useful starting point for the development of ameasure of the overall defense of Acacias, which would greatly enhance the understanding of thelife history and distributional patterns observed in this genus.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Kruger National Park|South Africa</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
