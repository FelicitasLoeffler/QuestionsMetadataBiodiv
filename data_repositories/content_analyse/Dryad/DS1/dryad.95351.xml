The role of intra- and inter-sexual relatedness in mediating reproductive conflict</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>As individual success often comes at the expense of others, interactions between the members of a species are frequently antagonistic, especially in the context of reproduction. In theory, this conflict may be reduced in magnitude when kin interact, as cooperative behaviour between relatives can result in increased inclusive fitness. Recent tests of the potential role of cooperative behaviour between brothers in Drosophila melanogaster have proved to be both exciting and controversial. We set out to replicate these experiments, which have profound implications for the study of kin selection and sexual conflict, and to expand upon them by also examining the potential role of kinship between males and females in reproductive interactions. While we did observe reduced fighting and courtship effort between competing brothers, contrary to previous studies we did not detect any fitness benefit to females as a result of the modification of male antagonistic behaviours. Furthermore, we did not observe any differential treatment of females by their brothers, as would be expected if the intensity of sexual conflict was mediated by kin selection. In the light of these results, we propose an alternative explanation for observed differences in male&#8211;male conflict and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>sexual conflict|kin selection|inclusive fitness|sexual selection|aggression|social behaviour</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
