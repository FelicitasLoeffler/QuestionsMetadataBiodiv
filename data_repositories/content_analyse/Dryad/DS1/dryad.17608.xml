Any temperature data collected in this area is reported here.  This includes Level 3 weather stations as well as smaller scale and temporal studies.  This data can be sorted and viewed by site, year, hour, height of measurement, mean, min, and max value.

This information can be found in the site descriptions and in the metadata.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>relative humidity|RH|humidity|BCEF|weather</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
