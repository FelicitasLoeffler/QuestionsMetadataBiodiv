Images are displayed at one frame per second, each image captured at intervals of two-minutes (i.e. 120 x natural speed). The puparia on the top row (A-C) were imaged with the dorsal surface uppermost (specimen B inclined slightly to the left) while the puparia on the bottom row (D-F) were imaged with their left side uppermost.  All puparia have their head at the top of the video. See text and Figure 1 for further explanation.  Note that the gas bubble in specimen D has already started to move from the pupa at the start of the video and that the process starts next in specimen E then sequentially in specimens B, C, A and finally in F.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>metamorphosis|pupation|pupariation|micro-computed tomography|X-ray|blow fly</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
