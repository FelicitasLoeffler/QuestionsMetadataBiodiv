Included are 8 files corresponding to 4 datasets 1)NUCL (nucleotide) based dataset and partition file (partitioned by codon n12 and n3), 2) N12 (excluding 3rd codon) dataset and partition file (by gene), 3) AA (amino acid) dataset and partition file (by gene), 4) DEGEN1 (nucleotide-based accounting for codon degeneracy) based dataset with partition file. Note, no taxa are excluded, although in final analyses rogue taxa are removed.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>tree of life|higher-level systematics|non-phylogenetic signal|systematic error|data filtering|discriminant function analysis</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
