Recently, environmental DNA-based approaches coupled with next-generation sequencing were developed to study soil biodiversity. Here, we optimized a protocol based on soil DNA to examine the effects of land-use on earthworm communities in a mountain landscape. This approach allowed an efficient detection of earthworm diversity and highlighted a significant land-use effect on the distribution patterns of earthworms that was not revealed by a classical survey. Our results show that the soil DNA-based earthworm survey at the landscape-scale improves over previous approaches, and opens a way towards large-scale assessment of soil biodiversity and its drivers.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Environmental DNA|Landscape|Land-use|Metabarcoding|Soil biodiversity|Spatial distribution|Earthworm</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
