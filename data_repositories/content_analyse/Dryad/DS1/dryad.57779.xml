The mixed linear model based composite interval mapping is used in mapping QTL. The software can simultaneously analyze the QTL maternal effects and embryo or endosperm effects, as well as their interaction effects with environments</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>software|qtl mapping|seed traits|mixed linear model|gene-environment interaction</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
