The experiments were reported in [Sackett, K. E., and C. C. Mundt. 2005. Primary disease gradients of wheat stripe rust in large field plots. Phytopathology 95:983&#8211;91.] 1st column: distance from the source of infection in feet. 2nd column: distance from the source of infection in meters. 3rd, 4th, 5th columns disease severity (percentage of leaf area infected) measurements in three replicate plots. This disease gradient is plotted in Figure 2(a).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>plant diseases|epidemiology|mathematical modeling|fungal pathogens</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
