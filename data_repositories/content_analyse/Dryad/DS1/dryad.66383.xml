Population= unique name for each population within each region within each country. Region= unique name for each region within each country. County= unique name for each country. latitude1= sexagesimal scale of latitude for each population. longitude1= sexagesimal scale of longitude for each population. latitude2= ordinal scale latitude for each population. longitude2= ordinal scale of longitude for each population. In the second sheet titled &#8220;Density&#8221; presents the colony density per location within each population in the course of the study. Location= unique name for each location within each population within each country. Population= unique name for each population for each country. Country= unique name for each country. No. of colonies= number of colonies per each location. Area (Km2)= area in Km2 in each location. Density= no. of colonies per area in each location.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>genotypic data|GPS location and density</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
