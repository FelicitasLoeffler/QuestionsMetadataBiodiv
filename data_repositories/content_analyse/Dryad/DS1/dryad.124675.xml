[2] for each climatic variable (MAT = mean annual temperature, Bio1, TMAX = maximum temperature of the warmest month, Bio5, TMIN = minimum temperature of the coldest month, Bio6, MAP = mean annual precipitation, Bio12).  Climatic data for each species for each climatic variable are summarized by the minimum, median and maximum values identified within its distribution, as well as the mean value across all localities that was used to calculate rates. Temperature values are in degrees Celsius*10 and precipitation values are in mm/year.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate change|plants|climatic niche</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
