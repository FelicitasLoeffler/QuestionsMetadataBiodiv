Leaves were approximately 1.5 mm wide. A wave gauge (MacroWave, Coastal Leasing) deployed at 1 m depth within the vegetation was used to record pressure data hourly (4,096 points) at a 5Hz frequency over 14 days (non-storm conditions). The data was Fast-Fourier transformed using Wizard (Coastal Leasing) to obtain wave parameters. Significant wave height was then plotted as a function of water depth, i.e. tidal height. Note that seagrasses occupied most of the water column at all times. During low tide, plant biomass is compressed into a smaller volume of water leading to lower wave heights. Error bars represent variability found in the 24 burst recorded daily for 14 days.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>seagrass|Chesapeake Bay|wave attenuation|Ruppia maritima</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
