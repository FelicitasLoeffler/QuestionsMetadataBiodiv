Measurements were collected using a StowAway XTI Temperature Logger (Onset Computer Corp. XTI32-05+37) beginning 2005-06-23.  The instrument depth was 004 meters, in an overall water depth of 20 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The sampling interval was 2.0 minutes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>EARTH SCIENCE : Oceans : Ocean Temperature : Water Temperature|Temperature|Integrated Ocean Observing System|IOOS|Oceanographic Sensor Data|Moored Temperature Data|continental shelf|seawater|temperature|California|United States of America|PISCO</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
