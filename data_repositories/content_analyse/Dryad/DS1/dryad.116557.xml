Column names for the model coefficients use the following notation: coefficient = parameter(covariate) and standard error = SEparameter(covariate). Parameter abbreviations are p = detection probability, psi = initial occupancy, col = colonization/settlement, ext = extinction/vacancy.  Parameter(Int) refers to the intercept. &#8216;nPars&#8217; is the number of parameters estimated in the model. Each model is ranked by its AIC score, which represents how well the model fits the data. A lower &#8710;AIC (delta) value is indicative of a better model. The probability that the model (of the models tested) would best explain the data is indicated by AICwt.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Occupancy models|AIC model selection</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
