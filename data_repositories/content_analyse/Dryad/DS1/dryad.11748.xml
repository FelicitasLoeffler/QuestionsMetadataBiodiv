Successional Dynamics on a Resampled Chronosequence.</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>The purpose of this observational study is to describe the dynamics of ecosystem succession. The change in the number, type, and amount of plant and grazing animal species is monitored in more than 20 fields. These fields were previously cultivated, but then abandoned from agriculture at various times in the past. The fields were left undisturbed for plants to develop from seeds within the soil or brought into the fields by wind or animals. Permanent transects have been established in these abandoned fields for purposes of sampling in a consistent location from year to year. Permanent plots along these transects have been used to sample soil nutrients, (in particular, nitrogen) abundance of vegetation, species composition and herbivore populations. The sampling occurs approximately every 6 years. In the initial survey, 100 quadrats of size 1 by 0.5 m were sampled per field in 23 different fields. Abandoned fields included in E014 are 4, 5, 10, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 32, 35, 39, 40, 41, 44, 45, 47, 53, 70, 72, 76, 77. Fields 22(B), 29(A), and 69(C) were originally included in E014 but used for other purposes shortly after the start of the study. This experiment was established in 1983 and 1989 by principal investigators Johannes Knops and David Tilman.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition|Aeropedellus clavatus|Arphia pseudonietana|Melanoplus confusus|Melanoplus nymphs|Melanoplus sanguinipes|Spharagemon collare|Ageneotettix deorum|Conocephalus saltans|Melanoplus femurrubrum|Oecanthus spp|Orphulella speciosa|Phoetaliotes nebrascensis|Pardalophora apiculata|Scudderia spp|Pseudopomala brachyptera|Chorthippus curtipennis|Melanoplus bivittatus|Dissosteira carolina|Melanoplus angustipennis|Encoptolophus sordidus|Melanoplus keeleri|Tetrix spp|Schistocerca emarginata|Arphia conspersa|Conocephalus strictus|Melanoplus dawsoni|Atlanticus testaceous|Neoconocephalus ensiger|Melanoplus flavidus|Melanoplus foedus|Camnula pellucida|Chortophaga viridifasciata|Hesperotettix viridis-pratensis|Melanoplus fasciatus|Orphulella pelidna|Spharagemon bolli|Psinidia fenestralis|Gryllus spp|Chloealtis conspersa|Nemobius spp|Conocephalus fasciatus|Eritettix simplex|Hypochlora alba|Conocephalus nymphs|Nomotettix cristatus|Melanoplus borealis|Trachyrhachys kiowa|Tetrix ornata|Melanoplus differentialis|Conocephalus brevipennis|Scudderia curvicauda|Orchelimum spp|Scudderia nymphs|Amblycorypha oblongifolia|Scudderia texensis|Diapheromera femorata|Conocephalus nigropleurum|Xanthippus corallipes|Conocephalus sp.|Oecanthus sp.|Nemobius sp.|Scudderia sp.|Tettigidea lateralis|Gryllus sp.|Scudderia furcata|Oecanthus Adult|Orchelimum sp.|Atlanticus testaceus</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
