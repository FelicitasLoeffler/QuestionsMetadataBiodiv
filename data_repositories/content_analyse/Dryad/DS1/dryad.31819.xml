The two remaing plots were located adjacent to two  temporary snowfences erected near Saddle grid stake 49. The plots were  1x10 m, and were further divided into 10, 1x1 m quadrats. Plant  species studied include Acomastylis rossii, Bistorta bistortoides  and Bistorta vivipara. Ten individuals of each species present in a plot were randomly selected. Plants were tagged approximately two  inches behind each plant with an aluminum tag labelled with the  species abbreviation and plant number. Tagged plant locations were  determined using a Cartesian coordinate system with the outside corner  of quadrat 1 serving as the origin. These locations are on permanent file at INSTAAR. Data collection began on 1 June, or as plots became snow free, and continued until senescence. Missing tags were replaced  during the first week of data collection. Missing plants were replaced  by a new plant in immediate area and the new coordinates were recorded.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|Acomastylis rossii|Bistorta bistortoide|Bistorta vivipara|phenology|plant development|plant growth</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
