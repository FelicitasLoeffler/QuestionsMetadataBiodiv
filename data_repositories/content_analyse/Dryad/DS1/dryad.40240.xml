Columns include: family, leaf number at flowering (standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), height at flowering (standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1), relative fitness (=absolute fitness/maximum fitness of individuals), and flowering time (both standardized to a mean of 0 and SD of 1, and unstandardized).  Standardizations were made on the individual level data prior to calculating the average values.  Jill Anderson collected these data at the Colorado field garden.  The data file was created in Text Wrangler.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>adaptive evolution|breeder&#8217;s equation|climate change|flowering phenology|natural selection|phenotypic plasticity|Price equation|response to selection</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
