Data was collected in the laboratory. Columns correspond to: Strain Replicate: the name allocated to each of the replicate lines, e.g. H1 corresponds to replicate line 1 evolved on hard agar. In vivo Replicate: The in vivo growth rate production was measured independently four times in order to provide replicates. This value was averaged in statistical analysis. Agar Type on which Strain was Evolved: Strains were either evolved in hard or liquid agar. In vivo Relative to Ancestor: In vivo growth rate of evolved strain under each treatment group was divided by In vivo growth rate of ancestral strain under the same treatment to give a relative measurement of area dispersed. Averaged In vivo Replicates: Replicate relative in vivo growth rate measurements were averaged. Selection Type: Strains were either under positive or neutral artificial selection for dispersal. Caterpillar Fresh Weight: The weight of each caterpillar was measured before inoculation to control for the effects of caterpillar size on bacterial growth.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Type IV pili|Flagella|Virulence|Experimental Evolution</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
