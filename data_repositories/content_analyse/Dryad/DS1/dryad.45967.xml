Original tree is in 'Original Tree' tree block. 'Trees for simulation' tree block contains 100 trees with (i) branch lengths scaled to generation time and (ii) branch widths scaled to effective population size as described in Oliver (2013). Dated phylogenetic estimate was originally published in: Bell, C. D., D. E. Soltis, and P. S. Soltis. 2010. The age and diversification of the angiosperms re-revisited. Am. J. Bot. 97:1296-1303.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Coalescent Theory|Phylogenetics|Macroevolution|Speciation|Models/Simulations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
