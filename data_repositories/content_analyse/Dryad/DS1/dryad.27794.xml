Its goal was to improve our understanding of the boreal forests -- how they interact with the atmosphere, how much CO2 they can store, and how climate change will affect them. BOREAS wanted to learn to use satellite data to monitor the forests, and to improve computer simulation and weather models so scientists can anticipate the effects of global change.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>boreal forest|carbon cycle|biogeochemistry|Remote Sensing|Hydrology|atmospheric energy-water fluxes|Meteorology|Terrestrial Ecology|Tower Fluxes|Airborne Fluxes</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
