A key factor in a spatially explicit water-balance model is a measureof moisture in the soils over time for both calibration and validationof such a model.  One of the best methods of measuring soil moistureon a continuous basis is Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR).  To this enda network of TDR soil moisture sensors was installed at allmeteorological stations on Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.  At 2of the sites the sensors are measured on an hourly basis inconjunction with the meteorological variables.  At the other 4 sites thesensors are measured on a much less frequent basis - about every 2weeks.  Sensors were installed in pits in sets of 5. One sensor wasinstalled vertically adjacent to the pit to measure the top 30 cm ofsoil.  The other 4 were installed horizontally in the face of the pitat 5, 10, 20, 40 cm.  Pits were then backfilled.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Sevilleta Wildlife Refuge|Langmuir Labs</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
