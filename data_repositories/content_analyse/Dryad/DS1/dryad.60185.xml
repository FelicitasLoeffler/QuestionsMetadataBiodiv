Sample nomenclature is as follows: "2.5E-2" means this resistant line was produced using a selective pressure of 2.5uM Erastin, and was the second clone evaluated at that concentration. The column titles map to one parental and five resistant clonal lines tested: DU-145 (parental, sensitive), 2.5E-1, 2.5E-2, 2.5E-3, 2.5E-5, and 2.6E-23 (all resistant). Fold changes were calculated using the ratio of each resistant line/parental (column directly to the right of each resistant line). Average fold changes (resistant/parental, column M) and average &#916;FPKM (resistant - parental, column N) for each gene across all resistant lines were calculated. For these experiments, only genes with FPKM &gt; 0.1 in the DU-145 condition and FPKM &#8805; 1 for all other conditions were evaluated.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
