After segmentation in Mimics, jpg files were exported with fat tissue highlighted. Images allowed landmark identification and slice range for each ROI (region of interest) - chest, thorax and abdomen. Also, a txt file with fat area measurement for each slice was generated. Depot fat measurement was calculated by matching ROI slice range and fat values.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Migration|Fat mobilization|Grebe</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
