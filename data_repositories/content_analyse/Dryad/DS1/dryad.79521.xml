The sex-ratio of the offspring of uninfected mothers mated to specific males lines (which were previously mated to the injected females) was also determined to rule out meiotic drive.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Microbial Biology|Bacteria|Host Parasite Interactions|Insects|Species Interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
