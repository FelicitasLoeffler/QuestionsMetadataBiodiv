Each row gives identifying information and infection data for an experimental replicate. Columns: 1) &#8220;year&#8221; gives the year of the artificial inoculation experiment (2013-2015), 2) &#8220;site&#8221; gives the site from which experimental juveniles were collected (13 sites), 3) &#8220;treatment&#8221; gives experimental treatment. Control replicates did not receive parasites and are marked as 0. Infections in control replicates were acquired prior to collection of juvenile snails from the field and reflect early-life exposure to parasites. Exposed replicates received field-collected parasites and are marked as 1. Infections in exposed replicates are the sum of infections acquired in the field and after exposure to high doses of parasites. Susceptibility is defined as the infection rate in exposed replicates, 4) &#8220;source&#8221; applies to the 2014 artificial inoculation experiment in which two distinct sources of parasites were used for inoculations. Replicates exposed to source 1 (southern end of lake) are marked as 1, replicates exposed to source 2 (northeastern site, JMS) are marked as 2, and control replicates are marked as 0, 5) &#8220;replicate&#8221; indicates the experimental replicate, nested with year*site, 6) &#8220;uninfected&#8221; gives the number of female snails that were healthy in the experimental replicate, and 7) &#8220;infected&#8221; gives the number of female snails infected with Microphallus in the experimental replicate.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Coevolution|Ecology: evolutionary|Ecology: spatial|Evolution: host/parasite</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
