Block and place mark the seed position within a plate. Crosstype defines the reciprocal crosses. Group is the ID number of the mother plant. Ripening- and stratdays refer to lengths of the after-ripening and stratification treatments. Germination is the binary representation of whether seed germinated during the experiment (1) or not (0). Germdays is number of days from the start of the experiment until germination.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Speciation|Germination|QTL mapping</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
