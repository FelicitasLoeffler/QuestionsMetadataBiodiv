These read count files are used along with the fastq files simulated in previous step by 2c_drawreads.pl to create 2x10 libraries with differential expression among them.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bioinfomatics/Phyloinfomatics|Transcriptomics|Ecological Genetics|Gene Structure and Function|Genomics/Proteomics|Molecular Evolution</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
