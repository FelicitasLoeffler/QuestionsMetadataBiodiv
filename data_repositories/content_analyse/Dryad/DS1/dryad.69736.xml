The first line indicates the name of the microsatellite, with alleles coded in a two-coloumn format. Missing data is represented by "-9". Each line represents one sample's multilocus genotype starting with the sample name. The name is composed of the region, the colour morph (Y=yellow, W=white), and the year of collection (09=2009, 10=2010, 11=2011)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Colour polymorphism|UV-signaling|Fluctuating populations|Melanization|Population genetics - empirical</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
