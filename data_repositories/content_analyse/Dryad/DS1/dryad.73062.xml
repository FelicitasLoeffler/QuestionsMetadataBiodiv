Note: This script uses regular expressions that are specific to targeting the accession numbers of our contigs and those that were used for BLAST searches. It is to be used as a reference for writing similar scripts for similar purposes but will not work as is for datasets other than our own. Requires an installation of BioPerl. Running too much BLAST output at once will kick you off of the NCBI server, so restrict the number of queries to ~500.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>bioinformatics|BLAST|454-pyrosequencing|MAKER2</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
