These identifications are reassessed in light of recent work on the morphology of the radiodontan Hurdia. New specimens of Hurdia are identified from the Spence Shale, representing mouthparts (oral cones), cephalic carapace H-elements, frontal appendages, and a single isolated swimming flap. The shape of the H-elements allows H. victoria Walcott, 1912 to be identified from the Spence Shale for the first time. The flap is larger and more complete than any reported from the Burgess Shale and allows for a better understanding of the morphology of Hurdia swimming flaps. A 3D model of a Hurdia frontal appendage indicates that there is only one morph of Hurdia frontal appendage found in both species, and apparent morphological differences between disarticulated appendages reflect a preservational continuum caused by varying oblique angles relative to the seafloor. Peytoia should no longer be reported from the Spence Shale, but its presence is confirmed in the Wheeler and Marjum formations. New mouthparts (oral cones) of Hurdia from the Spence Shale and Peytoia from the Marjum Formation with surface textures of submillimeter-diameter raised nodes are described. These new features have not been observed in material from the Burgess Shale and suggest slight differences in preservation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>hurdiid</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
