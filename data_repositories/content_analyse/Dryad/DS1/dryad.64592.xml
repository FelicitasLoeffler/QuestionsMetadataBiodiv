Data generated from the whole plastid sequencing were combined with data from 10 gene regions previously sampled for Viburnum (Clement and Donoghue, 2011, Chatelet et al., 2013).   This tree was generated from the Plastid and ITS data set, and it was used to reconstruct the phylogenies associated with Figure 2.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>character evolution|chloroplast DNA|plastid genome|classification|phylogeny|phylogenetic definitions|phylogenetic nomenclature</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
