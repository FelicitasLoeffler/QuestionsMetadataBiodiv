Hence, novel materials developed for APDs require dedicated experimental studies. We have carried out such a study on thin Al1&#8211;xGaxAs0.56Sb0.44 p&#8211;i&#8211;n diode wafers (Ga composition from 0 to 0.15), plus measurements of avalanche gain and dark current. Based on data obtained from 77 to 297&#8201;K, the alloys Al1&#8722;xGaxAs0.56Sb0.44 exhibited weak temperature dependence of avalanche gain and breakdown voltage, with temperature coefficient approximately 0.86&#8211;1.08&#8201;mV&#8201;K&#8722;1, among the lowest values reported for a number of semiconductor materials. Considering no significant tunnelling current was observed at room temperature at typical operating conditions, the alloys Al1&#8722;xGaxAs0.56Sb0.44 (Ga from 0 to 0.15) are suitable for InP substrates-based APDs that require excellent temperature stability without high tunnelling current.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Al1-xGaxAs0.56Sb0.44|avalanche photodiode|temperature coefficient|avalanche breakdown|Avalanche photodiodes|Temperature coefficient|Avalanche breakdown</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
