Letters represent genotypes (different lengths) of the specified microsatellite. Based on breeding groups we knew Sire 32 and Dam 33 contributed to one brood together and to no other broods, while the remaining sires and dams had the opportunity to breed in any combination.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>opsin|visual sensitivity|cichlid|spectral tuning|gene expression|plasticity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
