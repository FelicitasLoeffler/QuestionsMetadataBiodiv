The second sheet shows the data on the behaviour of the three morphs in the field: time spent in a patch, time spent on a flower, and number of flowers occupied. The third sheet shows the data on the probability of an individual found in a habitat patch at the beginning of the survey to be missing at the end for each morph (1 = missing, 0 = not missing). The fourth sheet shows the number of females from each morph that produced one, two, and three clutches of eggs in the laboratory. The fifth sheet contains the data on the number of clutch and the days to hatching for each morph. The sixth sheet shows cephalothorax length (for those females that were measured) and clutch size for each morph. The seventh sheet contains the data of mother cephalothorax length, and individual spiderling weight and length for each mother morph. The eighth sheet shows the data of mother cephalothorax length and spiderling survival for each mother colour morph (1 = survived, 0 = not survived).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Colour polymorphism|Genetic variation|Life history traits|Reflectance spectra|Sexual selection|Predation|Signaling|Heritability</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
