The file is in .gtx format and can be opened and analyzed easily in Genetix, R, or with a common text editor. The file contains the data of 42 Propithecus perrieri individuals genotyped over 24 polymorphic microsatellites markers. The individuals are further classified in three "populations" that relates to sampling sites. Salmona et al. 2015 showed little differentiation between the three sampling sites, therefore the three "population" individuals can not be considered as belonging to the same population. A file containing the geographic coordinates of the samples is associated to this file. For further details on how the data was generated see Salmona, Jordi, et al. "Genetic Diversity, Population Size, and Conservation of the Critically Endangered Perrier&#8217;s Sifaka (Propithecus perrieri)." International Journal of Primatology 36.6 (2015): 1132-1153.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Habitat loss and fragmentation|Approximate Bayesian Computation|Landscape history|Population decline|Human colonization</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
