At present, however, there is little predictive theory for I. The growing importance in population biology of analyses of single-nucleotide and other single feature polymorphisms (SFPs) is a potent reason for developing an analytic theory for I with respect to a single locus. This study represents a first step towards such a theory. We present theoretical predictions of I between two populations with respect to a single haploid biallelic locus. Dynamical and steady-state forecasts of I are derived from a Wright-Fisher model with symmetric mutation between alleles and symmetric dispersal between populations. Analytical predictions of a simple Taylor approximation to I are in good agreement with numerical simulations of I and with data on I from SFP analyses of dispersal experiments on Drosophila fly populations. The theory presented here also provides a basis for the future inclusion of selection effects and extension to multi-allelic loci.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Population Genetics - Empirical|Conservation Genetics|biodiversity|drift-mutation-dispersal|migration|single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP|Population Genetics - Theoretical</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
