Year 1983 Gopher mounds</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>The purpose of this experiment is to look at the effect of NH4NO3 addition in an unfenced area.  The experiment is located in field E.  There are 4 different treatments  C, F, H, and I as defined in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt; in the "microplot" strategy.  The plots are 4 by 4 meters and are laid out in an 8 by 8 grid with 1 meter aisles.  For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e008/treatment.html"&gt;trmte08&lt;/A&gt;.  From 1989-1994 plots with fertilizer treatment 1 were treated as complete controls, receiving no nutrients at all.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
