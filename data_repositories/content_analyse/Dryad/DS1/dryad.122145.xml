Illumina sequencing performed using HiSeq2000 using 75 bp paired-end reads (v3 chemistry). Reads mapped to the pea aphid reference genome (IAGC) for each sample separately using TopHat2 (v2.08). The number of reads mapped to each gene from the Official Gene Set annotation from AphidBase (http://aphidbase.com/) was calculated by summing each read that overlaps at least one exon of any particular gene. Read counts reported for 36,401 genes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Insects|Molecular Evolution|Speciation|Transcriptomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
