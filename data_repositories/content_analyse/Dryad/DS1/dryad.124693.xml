Results shown are mean differences in rates among species for the intermediate model of future climate change, n is the number of species included in the comparison. &#8220;All species&#8221; are the original analyses, including species with some non-native localities. &#8220;Native only&#8221; indicates results after removing all species with any non-native localities. In the &#8220;Mostly native&#8221; comparisons, species with non-native localities were retained if they had similar mean values for climatic variables after the non-native localities were removed (i.e. all temperature variables differed by no more than 1&#176;C when non-natives were removed).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate change|plants|climatic niche</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
