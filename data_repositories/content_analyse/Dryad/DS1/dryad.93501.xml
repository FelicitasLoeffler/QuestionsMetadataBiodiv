HBV genotype sequences from GenBank together with their country of origin and accession numbers are presented. Wooly monkey HBV (AY226578-WMHBV) was used as the out-group. Relevant bootstrap values are indicated. HBV isolates from study participants are indicated by diamond signs. The scale bar represents 5% sequence divergence.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Hepatitis B virus|sero-markers|sero-positivity|genotypes|HIV-1|injection drug users|non-injection drug users</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
