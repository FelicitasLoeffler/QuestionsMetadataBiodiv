New information: We describe two new species of microendemic New Guinea Limbodessus and use a compact descriptive format flanked by enriched online content in wiki powered species pages. Limbodessus baliem sp.n. is described from ca. 1,600 m altitude in the Baliem Valley of Papua and Limbodessus alexanderi sp.n. from &gt;3,000 m altitude north of Sugapa, Papua.  Based on our analysis, we also transfer three species from other genera to Limbodessus Guignot, 1939, with the following changes: Limbodessus deflectus (Ordish, 1966), new combination, Limbodessus leveri (J. Balfour-Browne, 1944), new combination, and Limbodessus plicatus (Sharp, 1882), new combination.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>new species|high resolution photography|&#956;CT scans|DNA sequence data|minimalistic descriptions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
