Parameters measured were  temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and run of wind. The station was instrumented with a thermohygrograph  (regularly calibrated and checked with maximum and minimum thermometers  and psychrometers), which was equipped with a Bourdon tube (to  measure temperature) and a banjo-spread hair element (to measure  relative humidity). The thermohygrograph was situated in a white, all  wood, louvered Stevenson screen which was oriented with the door facing  north. Solar radiation was recorded on a bimetalic strip mechanical  actinometer. Ninety percent of solar radiation from 360 to 2000 nm was  transmitted through the instrument's glass dome. Wind speed (peak gust)  was measured with a 3-cup, AC-generating anemometer that continuously  recorded onto an Esterline Angus strip chart recorder. Run of wind was  measured with a Belford totalizing cup anenometer with a counter (at a  height of approximately 3 meters above ground).  Average wind speed was  calculated from the peak gust trace. The thermohygrograph and actinometer  both used wind-up or battery-driven clock drives that rotated the  recording chart on a right cylindrical drum with a fixed period  between 24 h and 861 h depending on the gears used. These clock  mechanisms were virtually identical and therefore completely  interchangeable among the instruments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|climate|weather|meteorology|temperature|solar radiation|relative humidity|radiation|run of wind|wind speed</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
