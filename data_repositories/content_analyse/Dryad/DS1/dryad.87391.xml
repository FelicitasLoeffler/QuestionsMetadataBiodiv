Eleven physical education students were tested while cycling and running at a &#8220;hard&#8221; intensity level (e.g., corresponding to Borg&#8217;s RPE (6&#8211;20) = 15). During the tests, participants reported their discomfort and pain on a body map every 15s. &#8220;Time on task&#8221; for each participant was divided into five equal non-overlapping temporal windows within which their ratings were considered for analysis. The analyses revealed that the number of body locations with perceived pain and discomfort increased throughout the five temporal windows until reaching the mean (&#177; SE) values of 4.2 &#177; 0.7 and 4.1 &#177; 0.6 in cycling and running, respectively. The dominant locations included the quadriceps and hamstrings during cycling and quadriceps and chest during running. In conclusion, pain seemed to spread throughout the body during constant cycling and running performed up to volitional exhaustion with differences between cycling and running in the upper body but not in the lower body dynamics.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Constant-power cycling|Constant-power running|Exertive pain|Volitional exhaustion</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
