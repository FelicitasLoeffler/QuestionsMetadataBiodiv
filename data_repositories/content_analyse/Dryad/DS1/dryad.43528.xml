RNA was extracted from four independently-isolated P. antipodarum lineages descended from wild-caught females originally sampled from three New Zealand South Island lakes: Lake Alexandrina (one sexual diploid lineage and one asexual triploid lineage), Lady Lake (sexual diploid), and Lake Mapourika (asexual triploid). Each lineage was represented by four arbitrarily selected adult females. For details on extraction and sequencing efforts, see the associated publication.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Evolution of Sex|Molecular Evolution|Molluscs|Transcriptomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
