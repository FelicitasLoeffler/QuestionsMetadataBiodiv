The script also reports P-values and null estimates of skew for each of the females used in this study (excluding the five females that produced offspring from a single sire).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>polyandry|microsatellites|dung beetles|paternity skew|post-copulatory sexual selection|micro satellites</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
