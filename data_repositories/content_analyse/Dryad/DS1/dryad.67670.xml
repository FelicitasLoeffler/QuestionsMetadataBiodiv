This .csv contains the average number of spikes obtained in individual neurons in response to light pulses of different durations (0.1 to 1000 ms, n = 17 neurons). Each row corresponds to one neuron. Each column corresponds to one pulse duration (the duration is indicated in the first row). These data were used to generated Fig. 1J.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Serotonin|Optogenetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
