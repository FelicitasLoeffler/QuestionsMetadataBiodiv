Recordings of particle velocity of a noise egg in a large aquarium measured for the egg used in the set-up (for description of the set-up, see material and methods). The noise egg was placed in the middle of the aquarium with its centre at a depth of 15 cm in 40 cm water. PVL was measured at three different depths: 10 cm (Z = -10), 20 cm (Z = 0) and 30 cm (Z = 10) and at four different distances (Y): 10, 20, 30 and 40 cm) to the right from the egg.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>aquatic noise|experimental design|animal behaviour</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
