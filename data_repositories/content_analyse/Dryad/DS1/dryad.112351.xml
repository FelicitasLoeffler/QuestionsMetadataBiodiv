The tree is based on partial 18S rDNA and the entire nuclear ITS1 gene region for 51 species in the genus Dactylogyrus and two outgroups, Thaparocleidus vistulensis and Clediodiscus pricei. The accession numbers were taken from the &#352;imkov&#225; et al., (2004). The tree was estimated using BEAST v2.1.3 (Bouckaert et al., 2014) on the constrained topology from &#352;imkov&#225; et al., (2006). We used a GTR + &#915; model of nucleotide evolution with separate partitions for each gene, a relaxed log-normal clock, and a birth-death prior.
