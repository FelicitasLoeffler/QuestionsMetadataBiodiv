Fifteen 9.8 cm2 cores were removed from the floating periphyton mat and composited into a single sample.  Percent aerial cover of floating periphyton was estimated visually in the field.  Data are presented in terms of grams dry and ash-free dry mass per area.  Total phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon concentration in the periphyton mat is also presented on a dry weight basis.  This is part of a continuous data collection to test the hypothesis that phosphorus and nitrogen limit productivity at the upstream and downstream ends, respectively, of the FCE transects.  Conclusions await longer-term data collection.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ash free dry mass|Shark River Slough|Everglades National Park|periphyton|dry weight|2003|production|%TN|percent total nitrogen|%TC|percent total carbon|total phosphorus|TP|2004</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
