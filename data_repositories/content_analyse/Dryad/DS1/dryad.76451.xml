From COSI_geno.csv, we randomly drew two haplotypes with replacement to form a subject&#8217;s genotype.(3) One replication of the simulated data (1500 subjects):     &#8226; "simu.dataset1.Y.E.txt" contains the trait variable and the environmental variable    &#8226; "simu.dataset1.geno.txt" contains the simulated genotypes</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Binary traits|Gene-Environment interaction|Rare variant association|GLMM|Marker-set interaction analysis|Variance-Component Methods</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
