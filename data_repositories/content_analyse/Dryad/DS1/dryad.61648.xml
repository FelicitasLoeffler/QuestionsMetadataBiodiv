Genotypes are also included for a single sample (n=47) of California coho salmon. Data were collected on a Fluidigm EP1 platform using 96.96 Dynamic Arrays. The archive contains three files: 1) 2010_Baseline_SNPset.txt is the genotype data in gsi_sim format (very similar to GENEPOP) with a header indicating the number of samples and loci, a list of assay names, population blocks denoted with "POP", and tab-delimited genotypes with one allele per column, 2) ReportingUnits_SNPset_2010.txt indicates which populations are included in each reporting unit, 3) SNP_names.txt is simply a list of assay names.  In order to these data with the software gsi_sim, all three files should be present in the Baseline directory.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Chinook salmon|single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)|genetic stock identification (GSI)|ocean fishery|genetic baseline</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
