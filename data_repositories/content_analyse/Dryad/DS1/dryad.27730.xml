The field site uses a full-factorial water table (flooded or raised, lowered or drained, and control plots, as well as a moisture gradient) by warming manipulation experiment (warmed, unwarmed) which are reflected in the plot column and the warming column, respectively.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Methane</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
