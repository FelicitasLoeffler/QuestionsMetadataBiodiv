We used mark-recapture models and data from 2,795 Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) pups individually-marked at 4 of 5 rookeries in southeastern Alaska (SEAK) and resighted for 22 years to examine senescence, annual variability, and covariation among life-history traits in this long-lived, sexually-dimorphic pinniped. Sexes differed in age of onset (~16&#8211;17 and ~8-9 years for females and males, respectively), but not rate (-0.047 and -0.046/year of age for females and males) of senescence.  Survival of adult males from northern SEAK had greatest annual variability (~&#177;0.30 among years), whereas survival of adult females ranged ~&#177;0.10 annually.  Positive covariation between male survival and reproductive success was observed.  Survival of territorial males was 0.20 higher than that of non-territorial males, resulting in the majority of males alive at oldest ages being territorial.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>survival|Steller sea lion|Marine Mammal|Population dynamics|vital rates|life history|demography</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
