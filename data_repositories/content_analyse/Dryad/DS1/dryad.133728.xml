When the identical data (in our case Pool-Seq reads) is blasted against similar reference sequences (in our case variants of a specific transposable element,i.e. the Cla-element), identical query sequences might fit to multiple reference sequences. This produces duplicates in the merged BLAST output. With this script retains the first occurrence of a query sequence and outputs a table of the same format as the input (BLAST -outfmt 6).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>BLAST output|filter duplicates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
