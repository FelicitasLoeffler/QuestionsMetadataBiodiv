The first tab contains the data where rows contain individuals and every two columns represent the diploid genotype. The second tab contains the identity of the polymorphic nucleotides at each locus. The third tab contains the marker names as described in Bachlava et al., 2012 PLoS ONE.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>latitudinal variation|local adaptation|phenotypic differentiation|population genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
