SSR names follow the format Ssco_[A]-[B] where [A] indicates the transcriptome contig where the SSR was detected and [B] indicates the number of SSR in the contig. SNPs:. The 80 validated SNPs sequences and their descriptive statistics. For each marker following information is provided: NCBI Submitter SNP (ss) accession numbers, reference and alternative alleles, call rate (%), minor allele frequency (MAF), global (pooling the three sampling locations) expected heterozygosity (He), global and per location deviation (p-value) from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and flanking sequence. SNP names follow the format [A]_[B] where [A] indicates the contig number and [B] indicates the SNP position in that contig. Target SNP is encoded in the sequence as [REF/ALT] where REF indicates the reference allele ALT indicates the alternative allele. * corresponds to p-value &lt; 0.0001. SIGN. means that at least 1 location is not in HWE for these markers. N.S. corresponds to not significant.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Next-Generation Sequencing|T2T/G2T|SNP discovery|Transcriptomics|genomics|bioinformatics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
