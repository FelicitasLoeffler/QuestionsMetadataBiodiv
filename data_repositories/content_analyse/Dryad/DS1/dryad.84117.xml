The insulin/insulin-like signaling and target of rapamycin (IIS/TOR) molecular network regulates metabolism, growth, and aging. With the development of new molecular resources for reptiles, we show that genes in IIS/TOR are rapidly evolving within amniotes (mammals and reptiles, including birds). Additionally, we find evidence of natural selection that diversified the hormone-receptor binding relationships that initiate IIS/TOR signaling. Our results uncover substantial variation in the IIS/TOR network within and among amniotes and provide a critical step to unlocking information on vertebrate patterns of genetic regulation of metabolism, modes of reproduction, and rates of aging.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>insulin signaling|insulin growth factor|molecular evolution|positive selection|protein co-evolution|reptile|mammal|bird</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
