Most of the prairies had developed after being abandoned from agriculture, but none of the savannahs had been cultivated. The history of burning varied between sites. Insects were sampled via sweep-net sampling, pitfalls and ant plates throughout the growing season in each of 49 grassland fields and savannahs. In total, 89,596 individuals of 1,167 species were captured and enumerated. Body size was measured for a subset of grasshoppers collected. The study was conducted in 1992 by the lead investigators: John Haarstad, Evan Siemann, and David Tilman.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
