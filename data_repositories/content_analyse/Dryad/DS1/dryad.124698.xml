Clutch initiation date is provided for all populations but Romania. There are two years of data for the potential contact zone in Turkey. Color patch codes: T=throat, R=breast, B=belly, and V=vent. Also included are rotated factors summarizing phenotypic characters which were used in analyzing divergence in phenotypes and selection pressures: [BodyBrightness], [ThroatBrightness], [Saturation], and [StreamerLength]. Age is denoted for individuals we could confidently assign to a first-year or older age-class (i.e. which we had banded as a hatchling or which was an unbanded breeder at a site where we had banded all adults the previous year.)</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Birds|Sexual selection &amp; conflicts|Speciation|Natural selection|Population genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
