These measurements are taken only when the marsh is wet. Measurements are taken using an Orion model 250A meter, and the probes attached to the meter are the Orion Thermo pH probe and the Orion Eh probe. All readings are recorded in field notebooks, and then transferred into Microsoft Excel. The Eh reading is taken when the Eh probe is attached to the meter and the word "Ready" appears on the meter screen. The pH and temperature reading are taken when the pH probe is attached to the meter and the word "Ready" appears on the meter screen.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
