Here, we assessed the success of the hatchery-assisted reintroduction of anadromous sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) into Skaha Lake, British Columbia, Canada, and evaluated the genetic consequences for native kokanee, a freshwater-obligate ecotype, using single nucleotide polymorphism genotypic data collected from reference samples of spawning Okanagan River sockeye and Skaha Lake kokanee pre-sockeye reintroduction, along with annual trawl survey and angler-caught samples obtained over an eight-year period. Significant differentiation was detected between sockeye and kokanee reference samples, with &gt;99% stock assignment. Low proportions of sockeye and hybrids were detected within 2008 and 2010 age-0 trawl samples, however, by 2012, 28% were sockeye, rising to 41% in 2014. The number of hybrids detected rose proportionally with the increase in sockeye, and exhibited an intermediate phenotype. Our results indicate that reintroduction of anadromous sockeye to Skaha Lake is succeeding, with large numbers returning to spawn. However, hybridization with native kokanee is of concern due to the potential for demographic or genetic swamping, with on-going genetic monitoring necessary to assess the long-term effects of introgression and to support interactive fisheries management.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Reintroduction|Fisheries Management|Hybridization|single nucleotide polymorphism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
