AM = animal model, C = clonal, FS = full-sib, HS = half-sib, MPO = mid-parent-offspring, SPO = single-parent-offspring   # Male.Female: Was a maternal or paternal parent used in SPO or forming a HS family   # Lab.Field: Lab = laboratory estimates, Field = wild estimates, Field/Lab = parental measurements made in the wild and F1 estimates made in a laboratory   # Species: Species   # Trait: The trait measured (this is copied and pasted from the original study removing case and white space is necessary)   # Group: Information on the experimental groups used. E.g. experimentally different temperatures   # Trait.From.Hansen.et.al: Is the initial information for an estimate sourced from Hansen et al. (2011)? Additional information has been added here.   # Trait.Type: Classification of the trait into B = behaviour, LH = life-history, M = morphological, P = physiological   # Sample.size: Number of individuals used in the estimation   # Trait.Mean: Average value for the trait   # SD.Trait.Mean: Any standard deviations reported   # Precision.Trait.Mean: Any precision reported   # Precision.Measure.Trait.Mean: SE = standard error, CI - Confidence intervals, Range   # Heritability: Heritability estimate reported   # SD.Heritability: Any standard deviations reported   # Precision.Heritability: Any precision reported   # Precision.Measure.Heritability: SE = standard error, CI - Confidence intervals   # Var.H2: Variation in heritability estimate   # Cva: Coefficient of additive genetic variance   # SE.ia: Standard error reported for CVa</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Conservation Genetics|Quantitative Genetics|Adaptive Potential|Heritability|Nucleotide Diversity|Microsatellite Diversity|Heterozygosity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
