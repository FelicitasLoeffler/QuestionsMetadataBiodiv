Information collected on seabird distribution and abundance at sea off southern California has been obtained since May 1987 as part of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI,  http://www.calcofi.net). This program,  initiated by R.R. Veit and J.A. McGowan, with funding from the National Science Foundation, has resulted in density (no. birds/km2) estimates of ~60 species of seabirds over the period 1987-present (Veit et al. 1996, 1997, Hyrenbach and Veit 2003, Yen et al. 2006).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Southern California Bight|Population Studies|Taxonomy bird|Habitat marine</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
