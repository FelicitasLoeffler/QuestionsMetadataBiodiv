The first set of files compiles a map of ecosystem services totals at district level. The second set of files compiles a map of Rotterdam's main roads. The remaining file sets compile maps of six ecosystem services at neighbourhood level: air purification (AP), carbon storage (CS), cooling (C), noise reduction (NR), recreation (R), and runoff retention (RR). These are calculated using data of tree (t), woodland (w), tall shrub (ts), short shrub (ss), herbaceous (h), garden (g), water (wa), and other vegetation (o) cover. Detailed information about the methods used to compile these maps is available in the publication and supplementary material.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Climate adaptation|Ecosystem services bundles|Green Infrastructure|Mapping|Spatial planning|Trade-off analysis|Urban ecology|Urban greening</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
