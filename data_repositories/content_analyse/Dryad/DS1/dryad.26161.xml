The centerpiece of the station's research program is a 50-year database on the food web of Oneida Lake, New York, that has been collected with support from the Cornell University Brown Endowment and from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The data are collected by personnel from the Cornell Biological Field Station and include limnology, benthos, zooplankton, phytoplankton, and fish survey data, primarily from Oneida Lake and spanning 1957 to the present. This data package contains tables summarizing data collected during standardized gill net sampling efforts conducted from 1957 - 2007.  The three primary tables summarize abundances of twenty-seven species for each sample date, yearly catch per unit effort for thirty-five species, and yearly totals by age class for yellow perch, walleye, and smallmouth bass.  Auxiliary tables contain latitudes and longitudes of standard sampling sites and explanations of species codes used in the primary tables.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Madison County|New York</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
