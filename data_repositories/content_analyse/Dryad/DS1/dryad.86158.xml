First, all bat interest-level scores are provided, with the reaction of each bat to each katydid call. Details on scoring are provided in the manuscript. Second, we provide the measurements for the individual katydid calls used in the experiment (number of pulses, duration, peak frequency, and bandwidth). Third, we we provide the measurements for the individual bat echolocation calls used in our analysis (duration, peak frequency, minimum frequency, maximum frequency, and bandwidth).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>gleaning bats|predator-prey diversity|eavesdropping|katydids|sensory-based niche partitioning</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
