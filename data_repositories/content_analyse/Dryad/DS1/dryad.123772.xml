Data are parts per million CO2 in air, with flow rate 300 ml per minute (STP) and measurements made at room temperature (21 - 23 degrees C). Although original data were sampled at 1 Hz, here they are uploaded at 0.5 Hz so that we produce files of reasonable size. Recording durations were 24 or 48 hours.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>anoxia|carbon dioxide|discontinuous gas cycles|lactate|oxygen|reperfusion</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
