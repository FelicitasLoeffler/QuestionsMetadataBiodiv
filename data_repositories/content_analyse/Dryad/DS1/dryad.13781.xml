The fraction of surface light is computed at 0.25-m to 1-m depth intervals depending on the lake. The light (PAR) extinction coefficient is calculated by regressing ln(fraction of light(z)) on depth z.Sampling Frequency: fortnightly during ice-free season - every 6 weeks during ice-covered seasonNumber of sites: 7</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|light penetration|light extinction</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
