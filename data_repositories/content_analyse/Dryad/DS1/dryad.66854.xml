Thin-sections of smaller partial left scapula P.5012 (A&#8211;C). Image A is in normal transmitted, B in polarised, and C in polarised light using lambda compensator. All three images show the same section of cortical bone in higher magnification. The bone surface is towards the bottom of the image. The primary parallel-fibred bone tissue is in various stages of remodelling by secondary osteons and erosion cavities. Two widely spaced incremental growth marks (i.e., lines of arrested growth, LAGs) are indicated with white arrowheads, whereas an external fundamental system consisting of about seven incremental LAGs is situated in close proximity to the external bone surface. Note the peculiar colouration of the bone cell lacunae in image C (blue colours), due to the infilling with green mineral phase (visible in A), i.e., chlorite.
