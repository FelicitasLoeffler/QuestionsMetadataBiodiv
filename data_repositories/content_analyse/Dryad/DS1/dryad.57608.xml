The data for each SNP begins with a line that gives the locus (GBS contig number) and position (position within the contig). This is followed by one line (row) per individual with the count or number of sequences with the non-reference and reference allele.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|climate|ecological speciation|genome evolution|genomics|natural selection|nextgeneration sequencing|population genomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
