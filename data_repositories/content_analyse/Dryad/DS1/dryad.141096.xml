Column description: "Landscape" is the ID of the wheat field within a 500m radius landscape. "Sampling_Year" is the year of the data collection. "Within_field_position" denotes the transects where arthropods have been collected. "Aphid_density" and "Predator_density" are aggregated numbers of aphids and predators respectively, collected at each transect. "Predator_Prey_ratio" is the ratio between predator and prey numbers. "Parasitism_rate" is the proportion of parasitized aphids. The remaining columns are the landscape variables crop Shannon diversity (SHDI), field border length in kilometers (FBL_Km), grassy field boundary length in kilometers (GBL_Km) and the annual change in aphid host habitats (%_&#916;Hab).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>aphid parasitism|crop rotation|edge effect|field margin|field size|landscape composition|landscape configuration|predator-prey ratio|spatial heterogeneity|temporal heterogeneity|predator&#8211;prey ratio</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
