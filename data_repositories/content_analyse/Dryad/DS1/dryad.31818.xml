The 25 plots are organized in a Latin square design consisting of 5 rows and 5 columns. Plots are numbered according to row and column, beginning with 11 at the northwest corner of the grid. Plot 55 is located at the southeast corner of the grid. Each plot has  dimensions of 1.5 m x 2.0 m. The corners of each plot are marked with rebar stakes. Each plot is divided into an evenly spaced grid consisting of 15 x 20 points on each side, for a total of 300 points, with each point situated 10 cm from its nearest neighbors. Plant species  composition was measured using the point-quadrat method every year. The  point-quadrat method used was similar to that described by Auerbach  (1992):   The point-quadrat method was used for estimating canopy stratification  and plant cover. Aluminum point-quadrat frames were 3m^2 in size, with  double-layer filament spaced 10 cm apart to make a 145 x 195 cm grid for  a total of 300 sample points per plot. Plant genus and species at the top and bottom of the canopy were recorded hits at each point. In  addition, vegetation condition and hit quality were recorded for each of  the data points.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NWT|Niwot Ridge LTER Site|LTER|Colorado|canopy structure|community change|plant communities|species composition|vegetation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
