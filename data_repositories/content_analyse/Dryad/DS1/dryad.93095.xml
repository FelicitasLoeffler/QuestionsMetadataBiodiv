Mutants A1-4 were derived from challenge with the ancestral phage while mutants E1-5 were challenged with evolved phages. WT denotes the wild type, susceptible strain.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>bacteria-phage coevolution|conjugative plasmid|mucoid conversion</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
