This is a sort of text file and can be loaded into R by source("dumpdata.R"), defining the following objects:* Y : a 3-dimensional array of observation of site occupancy state.      Each dimension represents: [Quadrat, Site, Time].* x : a matrix in which each row representing spatial coordinate of a site.* I : an integer representing the number of sites per quadrat.* J : an integer representing the number of quadrats.* S : a vector indicating the number of states modeled in each quadrat.* T : an integer representing the number of time points.* state_list : a list of vectors representing ecological states modeled in each quadrat.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
