It is ecologically valuable because it creates littoral habitat complexity but it is susceptible to manipulation by riparian process, in particular removal by property owners. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial scales at which human and environmental factors contribute to coarse woody debris input and output dynamics. Coarse woody debris, boat docks, and riparian trees (with the potential of becoming CWD) around the five lakes of the NTL-LTER site (Trout Lake, Allequash Lake (north basin), Sparkling Lake, Crystal Lake, and Big Muskellunge Lake) were measured in 1996 and 1997.Shorelines were characterized using a qualitative shoreline development index (SDI). The index included: (1) developed and devoid of riparian trees (i.e. lawn, boat launch), (2) few widely spaced trees, (3) some riparian trees and some understory, (4) substantial forest cover, and (5) undeveloped and heavily forested. All 5 lakes were surveyed in June/July 1996. Endpoint positions were determined by &gt;30 dGPS points. Shoreline data were subsequently divided into 10 m segments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NTL-LTER|Northern Highlands Lake District|coarse woody debris|shoreline development index</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
