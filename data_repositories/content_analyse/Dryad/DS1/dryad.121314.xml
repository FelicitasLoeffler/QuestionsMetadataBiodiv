Downscaled to 0.5deg lat/lon and extracted at decadal intervals from 2010 to 2100.  Downscaling follows same procedures as for paleoclimatic simulations.  Multiple climatic variables and models are included in this file.  To meet Dryad upload limits, this file holds data from 4 of 12 downscaled CMIP5 models.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate data|paleoclimatology|climate downscaling|climate debiasing|climate change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
