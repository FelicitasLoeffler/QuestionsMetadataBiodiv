"gap" refers to whether the paired camera from the site was functional or not when that particular photo sequence was recorded (N=no, there was no gap in the other camera, Y=yes, there was a gap, i.e. the paired camera was not functioning). Number_grazing is the number of individuals observed grazing during the photo sequence, number_in_rocks is the number of individuals observed within the rock-defined site during the photo sequence.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>disease transmission|foraging ecology|parasite avoidance|anthrax|camera traps|host-pathogen contact</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
