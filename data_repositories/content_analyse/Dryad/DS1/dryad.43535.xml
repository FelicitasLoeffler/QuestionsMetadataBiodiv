Positions of SNPs are relative to contig sequences assembled in this sequencing experiment. The software MIRA3 was used for both read alignment (i.e., contig generation) and SNP discovery. Both padded and unpadded positions are given.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Evolution of Sex|Molecular Evolution|Molluscs|Transcriptomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
