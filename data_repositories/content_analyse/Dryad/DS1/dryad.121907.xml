Invadopodia in RhoG KD SUM159 cells.</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>SUM159 cells stably expressing a RhoG targeting shRNA were infected with mCherry-cortactin adenovirus as in Supp Movie 1. At indicated times cells were stimulated to form invadopodia with PDBu. Images were captured at 15 sec intervals for the duration of the movie.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>cytoskeleton|invadopodia|Rho GTPases|guanine nucleotide-exchange factor|RhoG|breast cancer|cell migration|cell invasion</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
