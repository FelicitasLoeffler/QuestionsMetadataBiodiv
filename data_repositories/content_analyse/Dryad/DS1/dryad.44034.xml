The worksheets are named to correspond with the figures in the manuscript. &#8220;Figure 4&#8221; has field measurements of nitrate and DOC loads (g ha-1 day-1) and runoff (mm day-1). We measured discharge at Spring Branch and discharge was downloaded from USGS gaging stations at the other sites. &#8220;Figure 5&#8221; was created using discharge (cfs) downloaded from USGS gaging stations and dividing it by watershed area to get runoff (mm day-1). &#8220;Figure 6&#8221; has field measurements of mean C:N molar ratios for leaves, periphyton, grass, sediment, and stream particulate organic matter (POM). &#8220;Figure 7&#8221; has field measurements of 15N and 13C stable isotope signatures for leaves, periphyton, grass, sediment, and stream POM. &#8220;Figure 8&#8221; has laboratory measurements of denitrification potentials associated with glucose versus nitrate amendments. &#8220;Figure 9&#8221; has laboratory measurements of denitrification potentials associated with the use of leaves, periphyton, and grass as a carbon source.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>C:N ratio|denitrification|dissolved organic carbon|grass clippings|lipid biomarkers|nitrogen|organic carbon|stable isotopes|stream restoration|urbanization|urban stream</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
