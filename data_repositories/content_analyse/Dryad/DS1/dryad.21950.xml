Year 1989 Raw data by plant species</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>The purpose of this experiment was to measure the effect of NH4NO3 addition and different levels of pH on microorganism populations. The experiment was located in field B. This experiment was laid out as a full factorial design with 3 nitrogen levels and 4 pH levels. The pH levels strived for are 4.0, 5.5, 6.5, and controls.  The nitrogen levels are E, G, and I are defined in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutr024.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;.  The experiment had 4 replicates.  The treatments were randomly assigned to the 48 plots.  The plots were 4 by 4 meters and were laid out in a 6 by 8 grid.	On May 5, 1995, a wildfire burned all of the plots in experiment 24 in field B.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition|FUNGI|MISCELLANEOUS LITTER|ANDROPOGON SCOPARIUS|POA PRATENSIS|PANICUM OLIGOSANTHES|AGROPYRON REPENS|LATHYRUS VENOSUS|LEPIDIUM DENSIFLORUM|POLYGONUM CONVOLVULUS|PANICUM PRAECOCIOUS|VICIA VILLOSA|SETARIA LUTESCENS  GLAUCA|ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM LANULOSA|SILENE ANTIRRHINA|MOLLUGO VERTICILLATA|MOSSES   LICHENS|CAREX SP.|ANTENNARIA NEGLECTA|SOLIDAGO NEMORALIS|CYPERUS SP.|ANDROPOGON GERARDI|AGROSTIS SP.|RUDBECKIA SEROTINA|RUMEX ACETOSELLA|PANICUM PERLONGUM|AGROSTIS SCABRA|PHYSALIS VIRGINIANA|HIERACIUM LONGIPILUM|ARISTIDA BASIRAMEA|MISC.
