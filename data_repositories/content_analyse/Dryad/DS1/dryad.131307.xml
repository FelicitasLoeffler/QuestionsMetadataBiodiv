SNP names are radtag_snp position i.e. a SNP named 12_46 would be on radtag number 12 and the SNP would be at position 46 in the tag. Population abbreviations are identical to those in Table S1 of the publication.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>genomic islands of divergence|ecotype|local adaptation|genotyping by sequencing|sockeye salmon|divergence hitchhiking</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
