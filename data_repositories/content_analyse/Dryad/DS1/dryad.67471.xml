Details for all accessions genotyped can be found in Supplementary table 1 of &#8220;Landscape genomics of Populus trichocarpa: the role of hybridization, limited gene flow and natural selection in shaping patterns of population structure&#8221; accepted for publication in Evolution on July 8th 2014. This data file is a matrix with each locus in a row and each accession in a column. Genotypes are given in Illumina&#8217;s Forward strand as exported from Illumina&#8217;s GenomeStudio software. The numerical value after each genotype is the Genotype Call score. Loci with GenTrain score &lt;0.5 were considered failed assays and were not exported. The file contains data for the remaining 33,070 loci genotyped.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>FST outliers|Isolation-by-distance|Adaptation|red/far-red light|SNPs|34K SNP Illumina Infinium chip genotyping results</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
