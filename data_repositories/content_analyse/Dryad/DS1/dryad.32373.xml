Measurements were collected using an RDI 600 kHz Workhorse Sentinel ADCP beginning 1999-09-04.  The instrument depth was 015 meters, in an overall water depth of 15 meters (both relative to Mean Sea Level, MSL).  The instrument was programmed with a sampling interval of 2.0 minutes and a vertical resolution of 1 meter.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>EARTH SCIENCE: Oceans: Ocean Circulation: Ocean Currents|EARTH SCIENCE: Oceans: Ocean Temperature: Water Temperature|EARTH SCIENCE: Oceans: Ocean Pressure: Pressure|Temperature|Integrated Ocean Observing System|IOOS|Oceanographic Sensor Data|Bottom-mounted ADCP Current Profile Data|continental shelf|currents|ADCP|PISCO|California|United States of America</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
