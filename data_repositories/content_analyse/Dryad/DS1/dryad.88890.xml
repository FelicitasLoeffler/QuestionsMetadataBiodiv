The combined fastq file was generated from the all-sites vcf file for Harmonia (the E. macaco individual used for the de novo assembly), and was used to infer historic Ne using PSMC (Li and Durbin 2011). The vcf was generated by running GATK (McKenna et al. 2010, DePristo et al. 2011) on the filtered bam file (mapping quality 10 or above, duplicates removed), with the EMIT_ALL_SITES option and a minimum base quality of 20. The fastq was generated from this all-sites vcf using a modification of the vcf2fq function within the vcfutils.pl script (vcf2fqnonref, in https://github.com/sorrywm/genome_analysis/vcfutils_mod.pl), using a minimum depth of 10 and a maximum depth of 41 (0.5 and 2x the mean depth, respectively), and a minimum quality (QUAL*GQ) of 20.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Population Genetics - Empirical|Conservation Genetics|Mammals|Adaptation|Ecological Genetics|Molecular Evolution</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
