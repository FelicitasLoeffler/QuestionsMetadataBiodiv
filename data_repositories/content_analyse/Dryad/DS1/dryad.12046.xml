For each capture, data were recorded on species, date, location, sex, body mass, reproductive condition, and age class.  The purpose of data collection was to estimate the relative abundance of small mammals in 18 4-ha plots treated with burning (2 levels) or thinning (3 levels).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Tamias|Glaucomys|burning|thinning</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
