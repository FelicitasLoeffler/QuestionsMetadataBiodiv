For seated expert stick balancers, the time delay is 0.23 s, the shortest stick that can be balanced for 240 s is 0.32 m and there is a Embedded Image&#176; dead zone for the estimation of the vertical displacement angle in the saggital plane. These observations motivate a switching-type, pendulum&#8211;cart model for balance control which uses an internal model to compensate for the time delay by predicting the sensory consequences of the stick's movements. Numerical simulations using the semi-discretization method suggest that the feedback gains are tuned near the edge of stability. For these choices of the feedback gains, the cost function which takes into account the position of the fingertip and the corrective forces is minimized. Thus, expert stick balancers optimize control with a combination of quick manoeuvrability and minimum energy expenditures.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>stick balancing|time delay|predictor feedback|sensory dead zone|microchaos</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
