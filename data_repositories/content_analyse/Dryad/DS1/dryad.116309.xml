STK32 is one of the gene families that was identified as a neighbouring gene family to the PDE6 catalytic subunit gene family. The tree was made using the PhyML web server (http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>PhyML|STK32|vertebrates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
