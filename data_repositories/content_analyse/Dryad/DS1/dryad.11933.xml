Alder (Alnus tenuifolia Nutt.) is an early colonist of young floodplain sites, where it contributes greatly to soil development through the addition of nitrogen to the soil. White spruce (Picea glauca (Moench.) Voss) typically colonizes such sites later, it becomes established beneath a canopy of alder and willow (Salix spp.) which is sometimes overtopped by young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.). The alder may potentially influence white spruce both positively and negatively. Possible facilitative effects include protection of small seedlings from excess heat or heavy siltation accompanying flooding and addition of soil nitrogen, an effect that may extend for many years. Competition for light (and other resources) before the white spruce has overtopped the alder canopy may prove to be a major negative effects. This study seeks to determine the net balance of these effects on the floodplain successional sequence.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>artificial communities|Seedling|height|survival|alder|spruce</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
