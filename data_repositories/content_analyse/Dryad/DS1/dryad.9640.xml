The transplanted mussels are placed with in the exposed mid zone of the study sites or near the surface on moorings found within 1 km of the shore. In the intertidal, mussels are deployed in May and left out up to a year. The mussels are then collected and brought back to the lab to be processed.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ocean|Intertidal Processes|Intertidal Zone|Marine Biology|Marine Invertebrates|Marine Plants|Marine Habitat|Biosphere|Aquatic Habitats|Coastal Habitat|Intertidal Data|Mooring Data|Intertidal Growth Data|Intertidal Mussel Growth Data|Mooring Mussel Growth Data|Intertidal Coastal growth monitoring|Mooring growth monitoring|PISCO intertidal|PISCO mooring|PISCO|Temperate Rock Reef|Intertidal|Mooring|Growth|Invertebrate|Mussels|California|Pacific West Coast</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
