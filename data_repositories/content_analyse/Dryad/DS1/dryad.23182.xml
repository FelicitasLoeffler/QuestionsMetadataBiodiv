Editing in progress The following edits were performed: 1) Resolved edge matching issues with Baltimore County parcels that border it and fall within the Gwynns Falls Watershed. 2) BLOCKLOT errors were noted and if necessary corrected.  The BLOCKLOT ID is used to link the parcel data to the MD Property View A&amp;amp,T database.  It should be pointed out that in some instances a single BLOCKLOT ID in the Property View A&amp;amp,T database may correspond to more than one parcel.  There are only 14 instances were a single BLOCKLOT ID corresponds to 4 or more parcels, these are typically railroads, utility, or government properties.  In other cases a single BLOCKLOT ID may correspond to two separate parcels that are essentially one property bisected by a road.  There are other instances where there appears no logical explanation for a single BLOCKLOT ID corresponding to multiple parcels.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>MSA|Maryland|Baltimore|Baltimore City County|Maryland</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
