The spatial resolution is T21 spectral        truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees  latitude/longitude) and 20        vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8        degrees  horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic        part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water        exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate.        The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the        k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM)        (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with        absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol        particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate        aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the        sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2        micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by        an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical        distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant        in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of        greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2.  Three        integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the        control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of        greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and        the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment        GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually        increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the        experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well        as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering        (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the        way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not        included in any experiment.  The scenario of atmospheric        concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is        given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase        in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890        to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after        1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of        sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a        sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic        patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission        rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990, the        2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050, and the pattern is        interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to        give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission        rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The        sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts        from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate        concentration is ignored.  Discussion on the results of the        experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate        sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs        is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature,        Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website:  The A1 Family storyline is a case of        rapid and successful economic development, in which regional        averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions        between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this        scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely        linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small        families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population        grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven        billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of        retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in        private pension systems.  The global economy expands at an        average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is        approximately the same as average global growth since 1850,        although the conditions that lead to a global economic in        productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history.        Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the        high average level of income per capita contributes to a great        improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the        majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In        particular, many communities could face some of the problems of        social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the        20th century and in many places income growth could come with        increased pressure on the global commons.  Energy and mineral        resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid        technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to        produce a given level of output and increases the economically        recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per        unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent.        With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift        initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat        and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with        increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes        also translate into high car ownership, sprawling        suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and        internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per        capita. These factors along with high wages result in a        considerable intensification of agriculture.  Three scenario        groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the        uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion        technologies in this rapidly changing world.  Near-term        investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities        into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration        or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of        energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions,        but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the        variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive        scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2        scenarios, conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor        productivity or of rapid progress in &amp;quot,post-fossil&amp;quot,        energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of        B1 and B2.  These scenario variants have been introduced into        the A1 storyline because of its &amp;quot,high growth with high        tech&amp;quot, nature, where differences in alternative technology        developments translate into large differences in future GHG        emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in        this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a        utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy.        The concept of environmental quality mightchange in this        storyline from&amp;quot,conservation&amp;quot, of nature to active        &amp;quot,management&amp;quot, - and marketing - of natural and        environmental services.
