The resulting BAM file was then used for the identification of putative SNPs using SAMTOOLS and varFilter from the samtools.pl utility. We only considered nucleotide substitutions and ignored small indels. SNPs were filtered that had a mapping quality higher than 20, a minimum read depth of 3 and a maximum read depth of 90 (3x the average read depth, a strategy to avoid orthologous SNPs, e.g. in multi copy genes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Population genetics|whole genome sequencing|SNP|complementary sex determination|Inbreeding|Biological Control</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
