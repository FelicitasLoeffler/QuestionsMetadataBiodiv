The following genes were assessed: sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 2 (NHE2), sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3), epithelial calcium channel (ECaC), V-Type ATPase isoform 1 (V Type 1), V-Type ATPase isoform 2 (V Type 2), and the sodium-potassium ATPase alpha subunit, variant 203 (NKA 203). Expression is normalized to the geometric mean of three control genes.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>salinity|temperature|growth|ion regulation|gene expression|fish|Comparative Physiology|Phenotypic Plasticity|Transcriptomics|Adaptation|Natural Selection and Contemporary Evolution</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
