This dataset contains mass balance changes at each stake measured on the glaciers of Taylor Valley. The values are the result of an analysis of the raw data presented in other data files(glacier stake heights and snow depths, and glacier snow densities). Included here for each stake is the total  water equivalent mass change. The standard deviation or the range for each total is given.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>glacier|mass balance|water equivalent|Antarctica|McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
