In this region, there is one crop of rice per year, the fields are continuously flooded from transplanting to harvest, and there is heavy use of organic fertilizers, particularly pig manure.  The fields were studied under prevailing agricultural practices of the local farmers.   The results represent emissions under standard agricultural practices and the year to year variability of climate, fertilizers, available irrigation water, and cultivars.  The sample site was located near the village of Tuzu (29.5 degrees N latitude, 106.7 degrees E longitude), about 20 km east of Leshan City, and 100 km south of Chengdu.Data are documented in:Khalil, M.A.K., R.A. Rasmussen, M.J. Shearer, R.W. Dalluge, L.X. Ren, and C.L. Duan (1998), Measurements of methane emissions from rice fields in China, J. Geophys. Res. 103(D19) 25,181-25,210.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Methane</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
