This version has been modified to accommodate the new assignments of Z-linked scaffolds and those that that have been broken and re-named based on the read-depth analysis described in the supplementary information. See the file Hmel1-1_Scaff-Chrom_Zcorrected_20120730.txt submitted herewith for a summary of this information. Newly-assigned Z-linked scaffolds have been labled chrZ_unmapped, as their chromosomal position has not been mapped.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Hybridization|Admixture|Introgression|Sympatric Speciation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
