Column labels include: SampleID-unique sample ID, Pop-label for each of 6 populations plus original 20 founders for all populations, Gen-generation the samples were taken from, followed by 22 locus specific columns.  Each locus is given in two columns (labeled A and B) to display both alleles for each individual.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>docility|mean kinship|microsatellite|captive populations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
