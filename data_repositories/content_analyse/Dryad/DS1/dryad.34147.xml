This conclusion is strongly supported by reproductive behavior and morphological characters. Thus, we recognize the genus Fritziana Mello-Leit&#227;o for the three species in southeastern Brazil and Flectonotus Miranda-Ribeiro for the two species in northern South America.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>molecular phylogenetics|reproductive behavior|morphology</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
