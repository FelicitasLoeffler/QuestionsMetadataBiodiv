The unphased files contain a single sequence per individual, where heterozygous sites are coded as ambiguous bases and missing sites as "?". The phased files contain two reconstructed haplotypes per individual, where missing sites have been imputed using PHASE. Note that all files contain polymorphic sites only.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Birds|Ecological genetics|Genomics|Host-parasite interaction|Population genetics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
