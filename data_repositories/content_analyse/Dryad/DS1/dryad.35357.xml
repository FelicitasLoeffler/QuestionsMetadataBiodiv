The positions of actual specimens with parameters close to the values depicted on the diagrams are plotted by symbols representing their respective habitats (land, freshwater, and marine). The criterion for including a specimen on the diagram is that the measured parameters (W, T, and D) fall within a certain range of the plotted values ( , Ts, and Ds), such that W = , T = Ts &#177; 0.5, and D = Ds &#177; 0.1.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
