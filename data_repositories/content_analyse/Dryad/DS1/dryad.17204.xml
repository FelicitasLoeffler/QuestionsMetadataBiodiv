The plants are all from lowland forests in central Panama. Most are from old-growth forests on Barro Colorado Island. Many are from young secondary forests (2-20 years old) on the nearby mainla</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Canopy diameter along the longest axis|Canopy height observed|Dispersal syndrome|Leaf dry matter content|Flowering plant height highest leaf elongated|Leaf carbon concentration per mass|Leaf carbon content per area|Leaf compoundness|Leaf delta13carbon (13C)|Leaf tensile strength|Leaf mass per area|Leaf nitrogen concentration per mass|Leaf nitrogen content per area|Leaf phosphorus concentration per mass|Leaf phosphorus content per area|Leaf puncturability|Leaf resistance to fracture|Leaflet area|Maximum plant height|Plant growth form|Specific leaf area|Potential decomposition rate of litter|Seed dry mass|Seed mass|Stem diameter at 1.3 m (DBH)|Wood density (stem specific density)|Wood specific gravity|TRAITNET REGISTRY</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
