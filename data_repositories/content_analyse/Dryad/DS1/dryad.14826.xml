Parameters are measured at or close to the deepest part of the lake.  A vertical profile of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity are collected at 1 meter incrementsSampling Frequency: generally monthly for one summer, for some lakes, one or two samples in one summerNumber of sites: 45</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>North Temperate Lakes - LTER|dissolved oxygen|water temperature|conductance|conductivity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
