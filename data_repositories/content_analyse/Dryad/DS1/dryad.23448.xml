Pouyat, U.S. Forest ServiceIntroductionThe Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has established a network of long-term permanent biogeochemical study plots. These plots will provide long-term data on vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes in the key ecosystem types within the urban ecosystem. The current network of study plots includes eight forest plots, chosen to represent the range of forest conditions in the area, and four grass plots. These plots are complemented by a network of 200 less intensive study plots located across the Baltimore metropolitan area. See Baltimore's Vegetation Structure And Its Ability To Remove Air Pollutants And Sequester Carbon Dioxide, online: http://beslter.org/frame4-page_3b_02.html .Plots are currently instrumented with lysimeters (drainage and tension) to sample soil solution chemistry, time domain reflectometry probes to measure soil moisture, dataloggers to measure and record soil temperature and trace gas flux chambers to measure the flux of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane from soil to the atmosphere. Measurements of in situ nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and denitrification were made at approximately monthly intervals from Fall 1998 - Fall 2000. Detailed vegetation characterization (all layers) was done in summer 1998.Data from these plots has been published in Groffman et al. (2006, 2009) and Groffman and Pouyat (2009). Plot Locations and CharacterizationsIn November of 1998 four rural, forested plots were established at Oregon Ridge Park in Baltimore County northeast of the Gwynns Falls Watershed. Oregon Ridge Park contains Pond Branch, the forested reference watershed for BES. Two of these four plots are located on the top of a slope, the other two are located midway up the slope.Four urban, forested plots were established in November 1998, two at Leakin Park and two adjacent to Hillsdale Park in west Baltimore City in the Gwynns Falls. One of the plots in Hillsdale Park was abandoned in 2004 due to continued vandalism.In May 1999 two grass, lawn plots were established at McDonogh School in Baltimore County west of the city in the Gwynns Falls. One of these plots is an extremely low intensity management area (mowed once or twice a year) and one is in a low intensity management area (frequent mowing, no fertilizer or herbicide use). In 2009, the McDonogh plots were abandoned due to management changes at the school.Two grass lawn plots were established on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in fall 2000. One of these plots is in a medium intensity management area (frequent mowing, moderate applications of fertilizer and herbicides) and one is in a high intensity management area (frequent mowing, high applications of fertilizer and herbicides).Plot locations: Hillsdale 1: 39&#65533;19'28.14"N, 76&#65533;42'16.49"WHillsdale 2: 39&#65533;19'31.24"N, 76&#65533;42'28.62"W Leakin 1: 39&#65533;18'1.32"N, 76&#65533;41'37.08"WLeakin 2: 39&#65533;18'5.42"N, 76&#65533;41'34.15"W McDonogh 1: 39&#65533;23'44.31"N, 76&#65533;46'19.26"WMcDonogh 2: 39&#65533;23'52.26"N, 76&#65533;46'23.52"W Oregon top-slope - 1: 39&#65533;28'51.11"N, 76&#65533;41'22.50"WOregon mid-slope - 1: 39&#65533;28'51.32"N, 76&#65533;41'18.24"WOregon top-slope - 2: 39&#65533;29'12.74"N, 76&#65533;41'22.88"WOregon mid-slope - 2: 39&#65533;29'12.68"N, 76&#65533;41'18.62"W McDonogh 1: 39&#65533;23'44.31"N, 76&#65533;46'19.26"WMcDonogh 2: 39&#65533;23'52.26"N, 76&#65533;46'23.52"W UMBC 1: 39&#65533;15'8.82"N, 76&#65533;42'10.43"WUMBC 2: 39&#65533;14'6.50"N, 76&#65533;42'48.71"W Soil TemperatureSoil temperature is measured with HOBO H8 Pro Series Temp/External Temp data loggers from Onset Computer Corporation. One logger was installed in each plot at ground level using a wire post to anchor it. Each logger consists of an internal temperature sensor, which measures aboveground ambient temperature from -30&#65533;C to 50&#65533;C and an external temperature sensor which is inserted vertically to a depth of 10 cm in the soil. It can measure ambient soil temperature from -40&#65533;C to 100&#65533;C. The external temperature sensorMeasurements are taken once every hour. Loggers are downloaded every month to a laptop computer using an interface serial port cable. Because loggers used in our lawn plots are sheltered in a pvc pipe below grade, we do not use the internal temperature sensors and have no ambient air temperature readings at those sites.Literature CitedBowden R, Steudler P, Melillo J &amp; Aber J. 1990.
