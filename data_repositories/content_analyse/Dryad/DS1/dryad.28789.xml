Year 1993 Soil nitrate and ammonium</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This experiment was set up adjacent to E055 in the highdisturbance, garden area.  1.75 inches of black soil was added to the CCNHAsandy soil to make four 10' x 54' plots.  The soil was rototilled and aluminumflashing was installed to edge the plots and divide them into 48, 5' x 9'plots.  Equal amounts of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are added to the plotseach year in early May and late June. For a describtion of fertilizer added, see &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutr069.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt;. Seeds were planted with 6 replicates of each ofthe following treatments:1.   Agropyron repens monoculture 2.   Schizachyrium scoparium monoculture 3.   Pinus strobus monoculture 4.   Quercus ellipsoidalis monoculture 5.   Agropyron repens + Quercus ellipsoidalis on half 6.   Agropyron repens + Pinus strobus on half 7.   Schizachyrium scoparium + Quercus ellipsoidalis on half8.   Schizachyrium scoparium + Pinus strobus on half  The competition plots were split, with half invaded by seed and half to beinvaded by seedling.  For treatments 5-8, the right or left sides were chosenat random, to plant the tree seeds.  The plots were watered throughout thegrowing season to keep water from becoming a limiting resource.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
