Year 1988 Aboveground biomass data</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of adding different levels of NH4NO3 at different times during the growing season.  This experiment is being conducted inside the fenced areas of fields A and B.  See &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e001/e001.html"&gt;E001&lt;/A&gt; for description of fence construction.  There are seven treatments, six combinations of three fertilization dates and two nitrogen levels and one control.  There are 5 replicates of each treatment for 35 plots in each field.  The nitrogen levels are E, G, and I and are defined in &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/methods/nutradd/nutradd.html"&gt;fertilization details&lt;/A&gt; in the "microplot" strategy.  The times of fertilization are roughly May, June, or July.  See CALENDAR.DOC for exact times of fertilization.  The plots are laid out in a 5 by 7 grid and are 1.5 by 3.5 meters in area.  Aisles are one meter wide in field A and 0.75 meters wide in field B. For a list of treatments, see the treatment layouts in file &lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e025/treatment.html"&gt;trmte25&lt;/A&gt;.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Cedar Creek Natural History Area|Long Term|Ecology|Successional dynamics|Primary Productivity|Disturbance Patterns|Nutrient Budgets|Nutrient Cycles|Climatic Variation|Biodiversity|Ecosystem functioning|Nitrogen limitation|Fire Frequency|Plant Competition|MOSSES   LICHENS|MISCELLANEOUS LITTER|AGROSTIS SCABRA|ANDROPOGON SCOPARIUS|PANICUM OLIGOSANTHES|POA PRATENSIS|LESPEDEZA CAPITATA|ACHILLEA MILLEFOLIUM LANULOSA|BERTEROA INCANA|POLYGONUM CONVOLVULUS|POTENTILLA RECTA|RUMEX ACETOSELLA|HIERACIUM LONGIPILUM|MISC.
