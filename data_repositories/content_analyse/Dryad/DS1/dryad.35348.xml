The genotypes are organized by nests and the coordinates are given for each nest (except when not available). The nests are shown as collected in the field, sometimes two nests represent a single colony as shown by the genetic analysis. Each row represents a single individual and includes the following information: an individual code number,the caste and class of the individual (a=adult worker, p=worker pupa, g=gyne or a sexual female offspring, m= male offspring), and the genotypes at the loci FE13, FE19, FE49, FL21, FL29, Fy4, Fy7, Fy12 and Fy15. The allelic code indicates the length of the allele, and missing data is indicated with 0.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>microsatellites|multiple mating|polygyny|reproductive competition|relatedness asymmetry|caste differences</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
