Each RNA sample was extracted from a pool of three whole individual insects. The first column contains the gene identification number. All other column headings represent the individual samples. GR_S = short-distance flying insects from Northern Greece. GR_L = long-distance flying insects from Northern Greece. The data was used to determine differential gene expression using the open software packages edgeR and DEseq2.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Insect migration|transcriptomics|tethered flight|migratory genomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
