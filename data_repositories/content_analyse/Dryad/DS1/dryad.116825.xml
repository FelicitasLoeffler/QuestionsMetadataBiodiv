The results may be retrieved by other initiatives and will be deposited in data repositories. &#8220;User-defined analyses&#8221; are influenced by individual choices, including defined polygons (areas), taxa of interest, and fossil records. The user may also include data that are not yet published or are not public.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>data mining|divide-and-conquer methods|GenBank|tree calibration|multilocus multispecies coalescent|next-generation sequencing|Bayesian phylogenetics|palms|primates</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
