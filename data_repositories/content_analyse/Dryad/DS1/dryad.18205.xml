The ECMI set up Meteorological, Hydrological, Groundwater, Erosion/Deposition, etc. monitoring equipment at the USAIC Military Installation, Fort Benning, GA. As part of an ongoing monitoring plan, six locations were selected for hydrolabs to monitor surface water, and water quality measurements. During the Summer of 2000 there was a severe, and extensive drought causing most of the equipment to be removed from the field. Equipment has since been replaced, and data are now being collected. The ECMI team hails from the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Environmental Laboratory, Vicksburg, MS.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>hydrological</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
