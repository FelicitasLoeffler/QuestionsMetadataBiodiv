The study was conducted over a period of five days in theMapungubwe National Park, South Africa. The two habitat types studied were openwooded savanna and riparian forest. Ten test sites were chosen for vegetation and aviansampling. Vegetation was sampled for visibility (at varying height levels), height profile,species composition, tree density, and canopy cover. Avian data was collected forspecies, abundance, and presence. This was done by monitoring 60m x 60m quadrantsfor 10 minutes each. Birds in the quadrant were recorded for abundance, while birdsoutside were recorded only for presence. Visual identification was used to identify birdswithin the quadrant, while auditory calls and visual identification were used for presenceoutside of the quadrant. Our analysis statistically reflected vegetation structure andfloristic composition to determine patterns that influence avian composition rather thanspecies diversity. Changes in structural complexity and floristic diversity do not relate toeither losses or gains in avian species diversity, but do relate to a turnover in specieswithin the communities. Increased vegetation canopy cover correlated with increasedspecies diversity. Floristic composition appears to display the most valuable evidence ofdetermining the bird species assembled in each habitat, although we do not undermine theimportance of vegetation structure at the same level.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>SANParks|South Africa</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
