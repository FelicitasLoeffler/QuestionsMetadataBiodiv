Kill rate is the distribution throughout the 16 time bins of the time of kill from field-verified sites of wolves predating on moose. Crepuscular light conditions were calculated as the average proportion of a twilight period within each time bin, and total light conditions were calculated from a crude model assuming 0 for night, 0.5 for twilight, and 1 for daylight.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>kill rate|daily activity pattern|ideal gas model|temporal predation pattern|prey detectability|encounter rate</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
