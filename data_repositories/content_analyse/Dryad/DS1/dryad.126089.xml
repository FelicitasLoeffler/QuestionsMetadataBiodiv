Lifespan (days) measured for 80 lines of ~200 individuals per line and sex, measured across  4 replicate blocks. Individuals within lines share the same X chromosome (CHR = X), or major autosomes (CHR = A). Column headings are CHR for line type, LINE for line number, SEX for male (M) and female (F), BLOCK for replicate block, and LIFESPAN for individual longevity. For further detail see methods in Griffin et al., 2016.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>dosage compensation|faster X|intersexual genetic correlation|sexual dimorphism|X chromosome</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
