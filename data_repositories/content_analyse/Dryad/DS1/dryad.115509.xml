Control and T2DM mice were infected with 50-100 CFU of aerosolized Mtb H37Rv. Six months p.i., lungs from Mtb-infected control and T2DM mice were isolated and formalin-fixed. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared and confocal microscopy analysis was performed to determine NK (pink), IL-6+ (green) and dendritic (red) cell co-localization. Scale bar: 20 &#181;m (yellow bar) and 5 &#181;m (white bar). Representative images of staining pattern of three independent experiments, each with three per group were shown.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
