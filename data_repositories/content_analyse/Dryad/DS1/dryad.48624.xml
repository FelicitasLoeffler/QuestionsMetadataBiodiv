While the highest known frequency of bat echolocation calls is 212 kHz, the upper limit of moth hearing is considered much lower. Here, we show that the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, is capable of hearing ultrasonic frequencies approaching 300 kHz, the highest frequency sensitivity of any animal. With auditory frequency sensitivity that is unprecedented in the animal kingdom, the greater wax moth is ready and armed for any echolocation call adaptations made by the bat in the on-going bat-moth evolutionary war.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>bioacoustics|hearing|laser Doppler vibrometry|electrophysiology|tympanal organ</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
