Data were recorded in late spring, at the end of the species' growing season each year.  This data file includes: life stages of individual plants at census time, number of seeds and clonal propagules (secondary tubers) produced per plant, and mass of primary tubers, as a measure of size of individual plants. Data for manipulative pollination experiments (supplemental pollination and pollinator exclusion) are also included.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>demographic census|clonal plant|life stages|seed and tuber production|supplemental pollination</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
