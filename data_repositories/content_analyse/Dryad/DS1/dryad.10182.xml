Annual sampling of a number of salt marshes and transitional zones into the upland was begun in 1999. And has continued annually.GoalsThe goal of this long-term project is to look at how sea-level rise affects marsh evolution. Seventeen sites along Virginia&#8217;s eastern shore have been selected to study marsh evolution on both the mainland and the barrier islands.The original project established initial site characteristics.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Primary Production|Organic Matter|Biodiversity|System State/Condition|salt marsh|aboveground biomass|Spartina|Distichlis|Juncus</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
