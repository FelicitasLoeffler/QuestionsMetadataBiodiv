The file "fronhofer_experimental_evolution_main_data.txt" contains the time series data of population densities, movement patterns and morphology for range core and range margin populations. The file "fronhofer_experimental_evolution_dispersal_rates_font.txt" contains the data used in Fig. 1b, i.e. the dispersal rates of populations from the range margin at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. The file "fronhofer_common_garden_movement_data.txt" contains the data shown in Fig. 1c, i.e. the movement data of margin and core populations after the 2-day common garden period. The file "fronhofer_common_garden_growth_data.txt" contains the data depicted in Fig. 2, i.e. the growth data of margin and core populations (additionally also the data from "residents only", see Supplementary Information) recorded after 2 days of common garden.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biological invasions|Range expansions|rapid evolution|eco-evolutionary dynamics|dispersal</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
