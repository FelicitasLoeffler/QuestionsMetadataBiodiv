Vertical CTD profiles were collected at approximately 2km intervals from 0km to 25km during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure, optical back scatter, photosynthetically-available radiation, oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected during the upcast were deleted. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|GCE|LTER|chlorophyll|conductivity|density|depth|estuaries|hydrography|oxygen|photosynthetically active radiation|pressure|salinity|temperature|water column|Inorganic Nutrients</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
