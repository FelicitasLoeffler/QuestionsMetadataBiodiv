These measurements represent field collected populations of apple-, blueberry-, and hawthorn-associated Rhagoletis fly pupae. We photographed the pupae and then processed all images with ImageJ to measure the pupae length and width. These measurements were used to calculate a hemispherical cylinder volume of each pupae.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Ovipositor length|Parasitoid population dynamics|Phenomenological models</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
