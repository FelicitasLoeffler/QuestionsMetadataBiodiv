Year 1998 Soil nitrate and ammonium</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This experiment was established on top of subplots 24, 25 and 26 of&lt;A HREF="http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/research/exper/e055/e055.html"&gt;E055&lt;/A&gt; (1.2m X 1.2m plots).  Sheet metal was installed to divide thesubplots into 4 equal parts (subplots are 1.2m x 1.2m, sub-subplots are .6m x.6m). The resulting 12 sub-subplots (4/subplot = 12/plot) were plantedaccording to the following treatments:      1.   LC seed on top of established SS      2.   AC seed on top of established SS      3.   no seed added to established SS      4.   PP seed on top of established SS      5.   AC seed vs SS seed      6.   LC seed vs SS seed      7.   PP seed vs SS seed      8.   LC seed vs AC seed vs PP seed vs SS seed      9.   AC seed              10.   LC seed            11.   Bare ground (no seeds added)              12.   PP seed Where LC=Lespedeza capitata, AC=Amorpha canescens,PP=Petalostemum purpureum, and SS=Schizachyrium scoparium.Equal amounts of MgSO4, CaCO3, P2O5 and K2O are added to the plots each yearin early May and Late June.
