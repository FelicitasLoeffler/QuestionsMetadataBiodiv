[2] for each climatic variable (MAT = mean annual temperature, Bio1, TMAX = maximum temperature of the warmest month, Bio5, TMIN = minimum temperature of the coldest month, Bio6, MAP = mean annual precipitation, Bio12). For each tree and for each variable, we report the maximum, median and minimum values of niche rates among species, rates of projected future climate change, and the difference between niche rates and rates of future climate change.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate change|plants|climatic niche</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
