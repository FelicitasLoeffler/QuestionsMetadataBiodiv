Ancestral state reconstructions from MultiState in BayesTraits showing the probability of the non-macrostomatan phenotype (blue) and macrostomatan phenotype (yellow) for each node as well as the states coded for terminal taxa on the constrained, diversified FBD Tetrapodophis and Caldwell et al. (2015) fossils excluded phylogeny. As in Fig. 4, white areas of pies at internal nodes indicate the posterior probability that a node does not exist.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bayesian phylogenetics|relaxed clock|total evidence|ancestral state reconstruction|Macrostomata|limb loss</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
