All plots will be planted to a combination of northern red oak, chestnut oak, red maple, and pitch pine. Innoculated (with mychorrizae) and non-innoculated seedlings will be planted in the plots. Relationships between performance and mychorrizal infection will be determined. soil moisture - reflectometers light - photo diodes, LI2000 soil temperature - thermocouples</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Coweeta|LTER|rhododendron|evergreen shrub|inhibition|allelopathy</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
