Sampling is conducted at 15 mangrove creeks in two drainages: Rookery Branch and the North, Roberts, and Watson rivers.  The sampling in Rookery Branch expands over a 12-km stretch of ecotonal mangrove creeks upstream of Tarpon Bay.  Minnow traps are used to target small-bodied forage fish.  Sampling started in the wet season of 2004, and has been conducted three times per year at these approximate times: November (wet season), February (transition), and April (dry season).  In the Rookery Branch region, fish abundance varies markedly yearly and seasonally. Catches peak in the drier months, reflecting a pulse of movement by freshwater taxa into creeks as marshes upstream dry.  The timing of this pulse is closely tied to the pattern of water recession in upstream marshes, and has important ramifications for wading bird prey availability.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Minnow traps|Rookery Branch|Everglades National Park|fish|catches|2004|2008|Salinity|temperature|depth|counts|specific conductance|dissolved oxygen|percent dissolved oxygen</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
