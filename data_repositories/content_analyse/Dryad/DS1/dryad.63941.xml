This program analyzes allele frequency changes in experimental populations. The model assumes a set of experimental populations were founded from a single source population and that a sample of individuals from the source population exist. Further, the model assumes that individuals are sampled from each experimental population after a single generation. This software requires the GSL and HDF5. To compile the software try: h5c++ -O3 -o bgsr main.C mcmc.C func.C -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
