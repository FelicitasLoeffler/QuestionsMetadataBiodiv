Note that the Compare_Stacks_vs_AftrRAD.pl script must be run prior to running Compare_PyRAD_vs_AftrRAD.pl.  Also note that both of these scripts are starting points for analysis, and that any loci identified as not shared among programs should be double-checked manually.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Bioinfomatics/Phyloinfomatics|Genomics/Proteomics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
