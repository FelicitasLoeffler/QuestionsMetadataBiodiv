Population divergence is usually studied with respect to how single lineages diverge into daughter taxa. However, populations may not always differentiate in isolation, divergence of one taxon could create new niche opportunities in higher trophic levels, leading to the sequential origin of many new taxa. Here, we show that this may be occurring for three species of parasitoid wasps attacking Rhagoletis fruit flies. As flies shift and adapt to new host plants, wasps follow suit and diverge in kind, resulting in a multiplicative increase of diversity as the effects of ecologically based divergent selection cascade through the ecosystem. Biodiversity therefore may potentially beget increasing levels of biodiversity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>allochronic isolation|cascading divergence|eclosion timing|ecological divergence|host odor discrimination|host plant adaptation|niche construction|parallel co-evolution|parasitoid|speciation-with-gene-flow|tri-trophic interactions</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
