The following columns are contained in the csv:1. replicate - The replicate challenge experiment 2. completed - Were all 50 rounds of challenges complete?3. step - The round that the data row is from4. host_phenotype - The integer phenotype for the host - computed by considering the phenotype bitstring (e.g., 10100000 = 4)5. parasite_phenotype - The integer phenotype for the parasite6. host_iterations - The number of iterations of generating random host populations that were required to find a succesful mutant7. parasite_iterations - The number of iterations of generating random parasite populations that were required to find a successful mutant8. host_sequence - The genetic sequence of the successful host9. parasite_sequence - The genetic sequence of the successful parasite 10. host_avg_task_nands - The number of NANDs required to compute the hosts average task11. host_max_task_nands - The number of NANDs required to compute the hosts most complex task</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>host-parasite coevolution|evolution of complexity|evolutionary ecology|experimental evolution|digital evolution|community ecology|evolvability</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
