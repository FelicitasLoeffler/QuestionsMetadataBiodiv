Whereas the MTF site received limited human disturbance, the MSF site had been cleared for timber production by the beginning of this century and was abandoned after hurricanes struck the Luquillo Mountains in the 1920s and 1930s. We found that the MSF was dominated by successional tree species 50 yrs after secondary succession, and did not differ in tree basal area and litterfall rate from the MTF. Leaf decomposition rate in the MSF was higher than in the MTF, but this difference was small. Our results show that deforestation has long-term (&gt;50 years) influence on tree species composition and that leaf decomposition processes in secondary forest is relatively faster than recovery of tree species composition.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>LUQ|Luquillo|tabonuco forest|secondary forest|leaf decomposition|forest recovery|LUQ|Luquillo|organic matter accumulation|disturbance patterns|LUQ|Luquillo|tabonuco|second forest|trees|decomposition|hurricane|el verde|peer reviewed journal|LUQ|Luquillo|Nutrients and Carbon Dynamics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
