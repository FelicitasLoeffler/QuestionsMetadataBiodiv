Data includes the raw crustacean zooplankton data collected during a six week study period per each sampling day and mesocosm (indicated by sample number), the biomass of crustacean zooplankton in each size class per sampling day and mesocosm (indicated by sample number), physico-chemical data measured in the mesocosms during each sampling day, and average RMS velocities measured for each mesocosm (indicated by pond). The treatments indicated by numbers in the file correspond to: 11=CALM-CNTRL, 12=CALM-I, 13=CALM-F, 14=CALM-IF, 21=TURB-CNTRL, 22=TURB-I, 23=TURB-F, 24=TURB-IF.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Intermediate turbulence|crustacean zooplankton community|planktivorous predation|planktivorous fish|mesocosm</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
