The samples are the parental genotypes: YP, cv Yellow Pear. GBL, cv Gold Ball Livingston.  SM,  cv San Marzano. T1693, cv T1693. B95A, bulk with the 15 most round genotypes in 09S95 population. B95B, bulk with the 15 most elongated genotypes in 09S95 population. B96A, bulk with the 15 most round genotypes in 09S96 population. B96B, bulk with the 15 most elongated genotypes in 09S96 population. B97A, bulk with the 15 most round genotypes in 09S97 population. B97B, bulk with the 15 most elongated genotypes in 09S97 population. Also the 15 most round and 15 most elongated genotypes in the F2 GBL x YP (09S96) are shown.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
