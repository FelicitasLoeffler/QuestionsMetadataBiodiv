Selection in temporally heterogeneous innate immune environments leads to VSV strains with differential capacities to block IFN-&#946; production.</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This data corresponds to the graph in Figure 5. It describes the secretion of IFN-b in PC3 cells (as measured by ELISA) after infection with different strains of VSV experimentally evolved in heterogeneous innate immune environments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Adaptation|Fitness|Parasitism|Population Biology|Selection - Experimental</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
