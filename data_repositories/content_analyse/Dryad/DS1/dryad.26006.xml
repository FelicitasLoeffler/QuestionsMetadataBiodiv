TableToolkit is a web application that displays        spatio-temporal coverage of a dataset on a web form that allows users to subset those data.        It was developed for Santa Barbara Coastal LTER but could be extended to any project. It        takes advantage of the DataManager library distributed with Metacat and the Ruby on Rails        web application framework. This test dataset is one of many. This particular one contains a        dataset representing a single survey site with some null values mixed into the data as        NaN.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Test|TableToolkit</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
