Bulk density and organic Carbon, total Nitrogen, total Phosphorous, Cesium-137 and Lead-210 content were measured in 15 2cm sections from each 30cm core. The sampling locations were chosen to represent three estuaries of the Georgia coast (USA) that vary in delivery of freshwater and sediment. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of freshwater input on soil properties, accretion and accumulation.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|GCE|LTER|carbon|cesium|isotopes|lead|marshes|mud|nitrogen|phosphorus|sediments|soils|Organic Matter</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
