Convergence diagnostics for tree topologies sampled in C2.  (A) AWTY [20] plots demonstrating similar posterior probabilities for all clades across 4 runs, and (B) at different stages in a single run.  The topology convergence statistics from MrBayes and AWTY (standard deviation of split frequencies across runs) were also good ie low, being &lt;0.031 across all comparisons (see top right cells of panel A).  These patterns are consistent with good convergence.  The kink in one of the fitted lines appears to be an artefact of a glitch in AWTY.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>macroevolution|morphological integration|ClockstaR|tip-dating|morphological clocks|Bayesian phylogenetics|relaxed clocks</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
