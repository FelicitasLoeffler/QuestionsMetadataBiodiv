Presented are four selection treatments (C = Control, T = Trend, R = Red noise, W = White noise). split temp = two temperature environments the beetles were exposed to during the split brood experiment. replicate: replicate is nested within treatment (4 replicates per treatment). Fam = Family nested within replicate and treatment, per replicate 10 families were investigated. sex = sex of the individual measured. emergence day = egg to adult developmental time, i.e. number of days after egg laying until emergence of adult beetle.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Experimental evolution|Environmental change|Genetic variance|Split brood experiment|Sex specific plasticity|Sex specific environmental sensitivity|Insects|Genetic correlations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
