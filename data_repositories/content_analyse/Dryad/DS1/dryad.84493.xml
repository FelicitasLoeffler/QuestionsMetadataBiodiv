Data includes fire ant foraging behavior before and after five weeks exposure to ground-level vs. elevated foraging habitat types.  Recruitment to ground-level and elevated resources, disovery and trail formation times, extra-nest activity, and exploratory activity are included, as well as weight of food collected and final colony size.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Trade-offs|superorganism|social insects|invasive species</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
