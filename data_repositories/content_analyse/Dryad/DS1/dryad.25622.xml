Individual pieces of wood were mapped with an x,y coordinate for each end and a diameter estimated from the top with a meter stick. This allowed a precise measure of the length of the wood and an estimate of diameter to allow volume calculations. Decay class (1-5) was assigned based on the criteria of Harmon et al. Notes concerning moss coverage were also made. Diameters of snags were also estimated while their x,y coordinates were identified. Height above three meters was estimated visually. Stumps were idnetified as short snags that appeared to have been cut. Their diameter and height were also estimated. | Cross section pieces of wood from each decay class will be sampled for determination of density and nutrient content.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Coweeta|LTER|coarse woody debris</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
