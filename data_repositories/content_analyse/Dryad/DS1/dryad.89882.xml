The folders are named as follows: game_mutationrate_payoffconfiguration_behaviouralimplementation_mutationregime. The abbreviations stand for the following: IPD = Iterated Prioner's Dilemma game, ISD = Iterated Snowdrift game, NN = neural network, TM = 1:1 mapping, GM = entire-genome muation, LM  = per-locus mutation. Each folder contains 100 .txt files with simulation output. Time is on the rows (top row is the first generation), the frequencies of the different strategies (in the same order as in table 2 of the main text) are on the columns.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>social behaviour|simulation model|Prisoners&#8217; Dilemma|Snowdrift game|neural network|non-equilibrium dynamics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
