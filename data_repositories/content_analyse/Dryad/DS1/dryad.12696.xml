Estimates of NPPare important in understanding energy flow at a community level aswell as spatial and temporal responses of the community to a widerange of ecological processes. A long-term study has been establishedat the Sevilleta LTER to monitor net primary production across fourdistinct ecosystems: creosote dominant shrubland, black grama dominantgrassland, juniper-savannah and pinyon-juniper woodland.  Whilemeasures of both below and above ground biomass are important inestimating NPP, the described study focuses on estimating above groundbiomass production (ANPP).  ANPP is equal to the change in plant mass,including any losses to death and decomposition, over a given periodof time.  To measure this change, above ground biomass production(ANPP) is sampled three times a year (winter, spring and fall) for allspecies at each of the four sites.  In addition, volumetricmeasurements are obtained from permanent plots at the three sites tobuild regressions correlating biomass and volume.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>ANPP|biomass</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
