Following an initial sampling, toads were randomly assigned to one of three expression-frequency treatments (N = 42)&#8212;frequent expression (5x), medium expression (1x), or low expression (0x)&#8212;and sampled over five months. At the experiment&#8217;s conclusion, toad glands were expressed one final time for comparison, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of the secretions. Here we compare the baseline chemotypes to the final chemotypes among treatments.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Biodiversity|Ecology: chemical|Ecology: community|Ecology: statistical|Interactions: plant/herbivore|Phenotypic plasticity|Statistics: multivariate|Anurans (frogs and toads)</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
