The transplanted mussels are placed with in the exposed mid zone of the study sites or at XX depth on mooring found within 1 km of the shore. In the intertidal, one set of mussels are deployed in April and left out for a year. Another set is placed for 3 month and correspond in dates and duration to the mooring set. The mussel are then collected and brought back into the lab to be processed.
