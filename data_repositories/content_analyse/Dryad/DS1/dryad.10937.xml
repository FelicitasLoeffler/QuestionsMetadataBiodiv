The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Princeton University established the first Forest Dynamics Plot at BCI in 1980, as part of its comprehensive program of research in tropical forest biology, which includes plant physiology, canopy biology, and animal ecology. BCI Plot Data, Tables of Abundance, Plot Species and Soil Maps data are available.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Neotropical Tree Species|Forest Composition/Vegetation Structure|Forest Demography|Tree Demography|Canopy Characteristics|Forests</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
