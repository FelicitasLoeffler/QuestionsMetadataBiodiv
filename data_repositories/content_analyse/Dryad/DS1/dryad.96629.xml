We examined how variation in nutrients and physiological aspects of life history affect standard metabolic rate in Gryllus firmus cricket morphs that differ dramatically in flight capability and early-age fecundity. Newly moulted female morphs were fed one of 13 diets that differed in concentrations of protein and carbohydrate. Carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratios (RERs), nutrient intake and mass and lipid levels were measured. CO2 production and RERs increased to a similar degree in both morphs as food macronutrient content increased. In contrast, no difference in whole-organism O2 consumption was observed across the protein&#8211;carbohydrate landscape or between morphs. Both morphs similarly increased food intake as nutrient concentration &#8211; particularly protein &#8211; decreased, but differed in mass and lipid gains, across the diets. Modulation of the substrate used for respiration coupled with compensating aspects of morph-specific metabolism appears to buffer the effects of variable nutrient intake and life history on standard metabolic rate. That is, respiration rate can be highly canalized in the face of dramatic variation in both the external nutritional environment and internal aspects of intermediary metabolism.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>feeding behavior|life history trade-offs|nutritional physiology|respirometry</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
