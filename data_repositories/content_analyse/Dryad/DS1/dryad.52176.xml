From each specimen we measured the length, width and height of the neurocranium and took data on the total body length, tail length and hindfoot length from the specimen label. Data also included from the specimen database include county where the specimen was collected, sex, and taxonomic information. See the manuscript methods for more details on measurements and subsequent analyses.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>cognition|cranial capacity|urban evolution|fecundity|rodents</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
