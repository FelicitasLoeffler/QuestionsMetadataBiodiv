Data includes number of ECEs considered, type of study organism (e.g. plant, animal), and whether or not ECEs were effectively defined within the paper. All data on the ECE literature was collected using a literature analysis conducted in Web of Science with the term extreme* climatic* event*. We considered any studies that investigated the ecological impacts of ECEs and recorded the number of ECEs encompassed by each study. We used any ECE as defined by the author, as we were more interested in the number of events covered than the specific way in which they were defined. Review papers and meta-analyses were excluded. We found 243 studies, with the earliest study published in 1991.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Climate change|Climate events|Extreme climate|Multi-event study</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
