Proxies of abundance are therefore common, but require calibration and validation. There are many ways to calibrate a proxy, and it is not obvious which will perform best. We use data from eight populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) on the Oregon coast where multiple proxies of abundance were obtained contemporaneously with independent mark-recapture estimates. We combined multiple proxy values associated with a single level of abundance into a univariate index and then calibrated that index to mark-recapture estimates using several different techniques. We tested our calibration methods using leave-one-out cross validation and simulation. Our cross-validation analysis did not definitively identify a single best calibration technique for all populations, but we could identify consistently inferior approaches. The simulations suggested that incorporating the known mark-recapture uncertainty into the calibration technique added bias and imprecision. Cross validation techniques should be used to test multiple methods of calibrating multiple proxies to an estimate of abundance. Critical uncertainties with the application of calibrated proxies still exist, and cost-benefit analysis should be performed to help identify optimal monitoring designs.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Calibration|Chinook salmon|Convenience sample|cross validation|indices|monitoring|proxies|weighted regression</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
