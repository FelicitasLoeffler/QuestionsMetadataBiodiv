The first two columns give the reference contig where each SNP aligned and its position. The final column gives Nei's Fst between the dune and non-dune ecotypes, estimated by the 'basic.stats' function in the HIERFSTAT package of the R statistical software. The data are sorted on this column. The data columns are as follows: 50 dune individuals, 15 intermediate, 35 non-dune, 10 H. petiolaris and 10 H. annuus.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Local adaptation|Isolation with migration|Hybridization|Ecological speciation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
