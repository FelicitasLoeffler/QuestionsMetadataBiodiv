Also includes datafiles based on simulations used to estimate LRS and generation time with respect to the population size at birth N0 (used in Table 2 in article). The codes used to generate the simulated data are also attached.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Genetic Drift|Effective Population Size|Density Dependence|Environmental Stochasticity|Demographic Stochasticity|Fluctuating Populations</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
