Studies of their morphology and taphonomy reveal that the inner cross-wall of Megathrix longus is topographically flat, the trichome terminus is blunt and closed, and incomplete cross-walls are regularly intercalated between complete ones. The deformation of trichomes, as well as the corrugation of their cross-walls, are postmortem features caused by compaction, rather than biological features as previously interpreted. Statistical analysis indicates that chamber division is accomplished by the closure of incomplete cross-walls. This process, which contributed to trichome growth, is extremely similar to that of modern Oscillatoriaceae. Trichome fragmentation was also observed in a series of specimens, which closely resembles that of cyanobacteria, particularly the Oscillatoriaceae. The termini of Megathrix longus suggest that it was planktonic. In general, Megathrix longus bears a close affinity to the extant Oscillatoriaceae (Cyanophyta).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Paleontology|Evolution|Phylogenetic affinity</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
