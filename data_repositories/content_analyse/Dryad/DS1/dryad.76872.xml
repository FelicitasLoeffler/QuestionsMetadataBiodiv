Represents the unprocessed p53 core domain that contains the cancer mutation M237I but no other introduced mutations. This sample was prepared to analyze and control the baseline error rates associated with the procedure, as well as the intrinsic NGS sequencing error rates.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>NGS|Next Generation Sequencing|Bioinformatics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
