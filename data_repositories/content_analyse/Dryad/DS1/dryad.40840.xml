These distances were calculated using the meandistance.matrix function in the R package "polysat" version 0.1, using the Bruvo.distance measure.  Each file contains a square matrix with row names and column names (sample names), as produced by the write.csv function in R version 2.11 under default parameters.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>hybridization|invasive species|polyploidy|Rubus|SSR</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
