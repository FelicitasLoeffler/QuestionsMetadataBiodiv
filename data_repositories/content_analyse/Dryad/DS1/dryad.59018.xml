These data were used along with species specific information on leaf area index and relative abundance, long-term temperature data, and information on the relationship between respiration and irradiance to model stand level annual respiration fluxes, using R for data analysis.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Carbon flux|Climate Change|Gas exchange|Leaf functional traits|NPP|Panama|Q10|Temperature response of respiration</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
