These start from 1880        to avoid the &amp;quot,cold start problem&amp;quot,.  This version of        the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in        the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to        earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global        mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02        degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction.        The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal        resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees).        The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21        levels.  The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed        layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the        high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995,        Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model        combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into        an &amp;quot,equivalent&amp;quot, CO2 concentration. Observed        concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a        projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year        compounding increase of equivalent CO2.  Another model        experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from        atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is        included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to        the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995)        and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are        the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the        chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a        present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4        W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas        forcing of about 2 W/m^2.  The magnitude of the 20th century        warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed        reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing        from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect        effect and the effect of soot.  The climate sensitivity of        CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for        environmental and social sustainability, but the character of        this world differs substantially.  Education and welfare        programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality        and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about        10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United        Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at        an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100        the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion.        International income differences decrease, although not as        rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1).        Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development        of stronger community support networks.  Generally high        educational levels promote both development and environmental        protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few        remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to        address global environmental challenges are less successful than        in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing        agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual        economic benefits.  The B2 storyline presents a particularly        favorable climate for community initiative and social        innovation, especially in view of high educational levels.        Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and        innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally,        investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and        mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and        know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher        than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic        development and limited natural resources place particular        emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation.        Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of        GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the        average historical experience of the last two centuries.        Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level        in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a        particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low        level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on        food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns        towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in        countries with high population densities.  Energy systems differ        from region to region, depending on the availability of natural        resources. The need to use energy and other resources more        efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive        technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at        the regional level leads to success in the management of some        transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due        to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in        agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in        lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of        elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy        system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is        a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil        resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction        in carbon intensity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate|global climate change|temperature</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
