Long-term variability and dynamics of estuarine meiobenthic populations (1973-1992).</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>The original purpose of this research was to determine if natural     meiobenthic assemblages exhibited continuity over time and to monitor     several physical variables to determine if these influenced long-term     temporal patterns.  The most recent study focused on variation and the     relations of meiobenthos abundance with environmental factors over 11     years.  Typically marine benthic community studies are limited temporally     and the majority of previously published 'longterm' meiofauna results (all     taxa) were based on about a year's duration.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgetown|South Carolina</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
