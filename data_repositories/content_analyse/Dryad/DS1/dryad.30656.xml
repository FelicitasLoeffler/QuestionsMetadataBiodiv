A copy of the Study Plan may be downloaded at http://ag.arizona.edu/SRER/study15/study15.txt.Measurements were taken annually from 1959-1966 on permanent line transects in each of two pastures. Transects were established at distances of 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 yards from each of five water sources. Fifty transects (two sets of five at each water source) were measured in pasture 6A. Ten transects (two sets of five at one water source shared with pasture 6A) were measured in pasture 6B.A water-rotation schedule in pasture 6A specified only one water source to be open at a time. The water source for pasture 6B was open continuously.The study area was grazed yearlong by cattle.Cover was measured in late summer or autumn in units of 0.01 ft. Perennial grass was recorded as basal intercept, i.e., length of live root crown portion of tuft at ground level. Shrub cover was recorded as the entire live crown intercept excluding conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown.Taxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The code OTHSHRUB refers to unidentified shrub species.Sources of data were the original field data sheets.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>grazing|semidesert grass-shrub ranges|Arizona|perennial grass basal cover data|shrub foliar cover data</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
