A fundamental prediction of predator-driven colour divergence is that the local coloration should experience lower predation risk than novel prey phenotypes. The dorsal coloration of the granular poison frog varies gradually from populations of conspicuous bright red frogs to populations of dull green and relatively cryptic frogs. We conducted experiments with clay models in four populations to examine the geographic patterns of taxon-specific predation. Birds avoided the local phenotype while lizards consistently selected for decreased conspicuousness and crab predation did not depend on frog coloration. Importantly, birds and lizards favoured low conspicuousness in populations where relatively cryptic green morphs have evolved. This study provides evidence for the interplay among distinct selective pressures, from multiple-predator taxa, acting on the divergence in protective coloration of prey species.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>predation|natural selection|adaptation</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
