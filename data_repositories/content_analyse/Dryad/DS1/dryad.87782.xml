However, escalating stressful conditions enable some symbionts to thrive as opportunists. We present evidence that a stress-tolerant &#8220;zooxanthella&#8221; from the Indo-Pacific Ocean, Symbiodinium trenchii, has rapidly spread to coral communities across the Greater Caribbean. In marked contrast to populations from the Indo-Pacific, Atlantic populations of S. trenchii contained exceptionally low genetic diversity, including several widespread and genetically similar clones. Colonies with this symbiont tolerate temperatures 1&#8211;2 &#176;C higher than other host&#8211;symbiont combinations, however, calcification by hosts harboring S. trenchii is reduced by nearly half, compared with those harboring natives, and suggests that these new symbioses are maladapted. Unforeseen opportunism and geographical expansion by invasive mutualistic microbes could profoundly influence the response of reef coral symbioses to major environmental perturbations but may ultimately compromise ecosystem stability and function.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>invasive species|climate change|reef corals|calcification|symbiosis</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
