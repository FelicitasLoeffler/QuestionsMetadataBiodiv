Evolutionary relationships of the different type VI secretion systems of Pantoea ananatis using concatenated TssB and TssC amino acid sequences.</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>This figure shows the evolutionary history of the type VI secretion systems (T6SS) found in strains of Pantoea ananatis. Evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood Method using the LG amino acid substitution model.  The TssB/C homologs used in this study are indicated next to the name of the bacteria. Blue octagons represent T6SS phylogenetic Groups A-D proposed by Bingle et al. (2008). Representative position of PA T6SS-1 and PA T6SS-2 are shown in blue and green rectangles, respectively.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Type VI secretion system|T6SS|phytopathogen</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
