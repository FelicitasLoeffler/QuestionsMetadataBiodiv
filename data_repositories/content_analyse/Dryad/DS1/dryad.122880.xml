Column Names -- "Block" is a number 1-5 that represents the spatial block in which the plant is located, "Plant_ID" is a unique number used to identify each plant in the experiment, "Myco_fungi" and "Rhizobia" indicates the presence (+) or absence (-) of mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia treatments, "#_Branches" and "#_Trifoliate_Leaves" are counts of total number of plant branches and leaves , and "Week" indicates the week post-inoculation that the data was collected. Note that data was collected at three time points.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Transcriptome|RNA-Seq|rhizobia|legume|MME|symbiosis|mutualism|mycorrhizal fungi|Medicago|multiple mutualism effects|multispecies mutualism</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
