Branch lengths are drawn to scale, with scale bar indicating the number of amino acid substitutions. Numbers on branches are the bootstrap values of the clusters on the right.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>integron|comparative genomics|metagenomics|horizontal gene transfer|selective pressures</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
