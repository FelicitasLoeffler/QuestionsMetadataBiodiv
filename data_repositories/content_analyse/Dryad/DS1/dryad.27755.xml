The purpose of the dataset was to integrate the effects of temperature and resource availability on bacterial production using metabolic scaling theory and the kinetics of EEA.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>extracellular enzyme|bacterial production|river|metabolic theory|michaelis-menten</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
