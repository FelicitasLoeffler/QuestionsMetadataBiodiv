"treatment" refers to the experimental community composition. "density" is reported in individuals/ml. patch: "S" (starting conditions, i.e., at the beginning of the experiment), "P1" (start/origin patch), "P2" (target patch)2) movement_data.txt: contains the individual-level movement and morphology data from the video analysis. The file contains information on: velocity ("velocity_metric") measured in mm/s, turning angle distribution width ("sd_turning") measured as the standard devidation, the net distance travelled ("euclidean_metric") measured in mm, as well as morphological parameters, specifically the length along the major axis in &#181;m and the aspect ratio (major/minor).3) growthCurves_data.txt: Sample-level density data from video analysis for determining r0 and K of all three species (see Fig. S1). "time" is reported in hours and captures the time since the beginning of the growth experiment.4) communityDynamics_data_interactionCoefficients.txt: Sample-level data from video analysis of all 2-species communities used to determine interaction coefficients (see Fig. S3).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>inter-specific competition|plasticity|reaction norm|density-dependent dispersal|density-dependent movement|Allee effect|microcosms|protists</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
