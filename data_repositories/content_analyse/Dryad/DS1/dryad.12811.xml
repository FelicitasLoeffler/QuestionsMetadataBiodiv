In addition, above variables are reported for pools and riffles located at PRASA Intake (R&#237;o Mameyes) and at La Curvita (R&#237;o Esp&#237;ritu Santo).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>LUQ|Luquillo|tropical streams|puerto rico|streambed roughness|neritina virginea|habitat complexity|human disturbances|lotic populations|hydraulics|hydromodifications|amphidromous fauna|LUQ|Luquillo|population dynamics|disturbance patterns|LUQ|Luquillo|peer reviewed journal|population dynamics|quebrada mameyes|road|river|discharge|aquatic gastropods (mollusks)|dissertation|environmental variables|human|LUQ|Luquillo|Animal Population Dynamics</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
