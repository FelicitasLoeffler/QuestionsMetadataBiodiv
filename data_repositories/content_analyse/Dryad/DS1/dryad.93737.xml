Matrices were transposed to columns (focal bird) and rows (non-focal bird), and supplemented with information on: Trial, day, identity, sex and call type of focal and non-focal bird, whether interacting birds were pair members (Pairmembers(y/no)), whether vocal interactions were positive, non-significant or negative (Interaction(pos/0/neg), how call types were combined (combination.type), whether focal bird was in a pair that produced a clutch of eggs (focal.eggslaid), reproductive stage of the focal bird (nest.stage = summary, breeding.stage = more detailed).</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>call communication|vocal interactions|social group|breeding stages</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
