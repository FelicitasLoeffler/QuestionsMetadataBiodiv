Five family groups were collected, each with a data structure containing information for the call start and end times between pairs in the group. The five group structures are save in matlab files, as G_info4, R_info4, M_info4, O_info4, and J_info4. Each file has the same format, following as a 6 x 10 cell structure. The columns 1-10 corresponds to months, starting from month 3, so they arein sequence months 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. The rows correspond to different pairs of family members conversing, # - first to second speaker. 1 - mother to baby 1, 2 - mother to baby 2, 3 - father to baby 1, 4 - father to baby 2, 5 - baby 1 to baby 2. An empty cell indicates no data was recorded that month. Each cell has the following information for conversations: DateNum: [1xN double] % identifier for the N sessions recorded that month, Animals: [1x2 double] % animal numbers %**** call times for the first speaker  Astarts: [1xM double] % times in seconds, start of first pulse in a call. Afinish: [1xM double] % times in seconds, end of the first pulse. Astarts2: [1xM double] % time in seconds, start of the second pulse in call, NaN if no second pulse. Afinish2: [1xM double] % time in seconds, end of the second pulse in call, NaN if no second pulse. Atypes: [1xM double] % type of call, 1-phee, 2-twitter, 3-trill, 4-other, 5-unidentified. %**** call times for the second speaker. Bstarts: [1xP double] % same format as above for A, but for speaker B, Bfinish: [1xP double], Bstarts2: [1xP double], Bfinish2: [1xP double], Btypes: [1x265 double]</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Marmoset|Turn-taking|Ontogeny</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
