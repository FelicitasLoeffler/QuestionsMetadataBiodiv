More than 200 estuarine and coastal sites are monitored monthly for water quality (including chlorophyll, nutrients, turbidity (secchi depth and NTU), salinity, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) within southeast Queensland. At each site the presence or absence of jellyfish was recorded. Sites where salinity &lt;15ppt were removed from the data set as jellyfish are unlikely to occur in low salinity water.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Jellyfish|Catostylus mosaicus|Scyphozoa|Rhizostomeae|Water quality|presence absence</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
