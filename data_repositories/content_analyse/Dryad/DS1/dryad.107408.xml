(2016) - Journal of Ecology</oai_dc:dc/dc:title><oai_dc:dc/dc:description>Data of above-ground biomass dynamics over a five-year period in eight seasonal tropical dry forests in Minas Gerais state, Southeastern Brazil. In each forest, 25 permanent sample plots (20 &#215; 20 m) were established totaling one ha per site. Biomass dynamics, structural, floristic, functional and soil variables used in the biomass models are given. AGBi = stand biomass, AGBnet = net biomass change, AGBsurv = biomass growth of surviving trees, AGBmort = biomass mortality, AGBrecr = biomass recruitment, NI = tree-density (ha-1), CWM = community weighed mean, WD = wood density, Dmax = maximum stem diameter, SLA = specific leaf area, Dec = deciduousness, S = rarefied species richness, H&#8217; = Shannon-Wiener index, J&#8217; = Pielou&#8217;s index, Fric = functional richness, Feve = functional evenness, Fdiv = functional divergence, P = phosphorous, K = potassium, Ca = calcium, Mg = magnesium, Al = aluminum, CEC = cation exchange capacity.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>biodiversity-ecosystem functioning|biomass ratio hypothesis|carbon stocks and sequestration|community weighted mean traits|functional diversity|green soup hypothesis|niche complementarity|plant population and community dynamics|soil fertility</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
