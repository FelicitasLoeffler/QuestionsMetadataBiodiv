The zip file contains an OTU table showing the distribution of sequencing reads for all OTUs across the 36 samples, a fasta file with all 852 representative sequences for these OTUs and two taxonomy files linking the taxonomic classification of the OTUs based on the Greengenes reference set (May 2013 release) to the OTU IDs found in the OTU table and the sequence identifiers found in the fasta file.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Symbiosis|16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing|social parasites</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
