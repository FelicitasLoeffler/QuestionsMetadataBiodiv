Downscaled to 0.5deg lat/lon and 500-year resolution for North America for 21,000 years ago to the 20th century. These TIFS were generated from the decadal-scale NetCDF data, and extracted as climatic summaries comprising 200-year bins and spaced 500 years apart.  They are formatted for direct input into species distribution models.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>climate data|paleoclimatology|climate downscaling|climate debiasing|climate change</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
