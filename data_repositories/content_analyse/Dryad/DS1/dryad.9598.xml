Vertical CTD profiles were collected at 2-4km intervals from the -4km to 24km upriver along the transect during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure and optical backscatter were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected on the upcast were deleted, and the remaining data were averaged within 0.5m depth bins and interpolated to produce a smooth profile for contouring. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject>Georgia|Sapelo Island|USA|GCE|LTER|conductivity|density|depth|estuaries|hydrography|pressure|salinity|temperature|water column|Inorganic Nutrients</oai_dc:dc/dc:subject><date
