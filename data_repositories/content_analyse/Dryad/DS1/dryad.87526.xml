Design: Meta-analysis. Data sources and study eligibility criteria: A comprehensive literature search, using Medline (1966&#8211;2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Embase databases, was conducted to identify randomised placebo-controlled trials that used a combination of single-dose intra-articular bupivacaine and morphine for postoperative pain relief. Results: 12 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The mean visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the bupivacaine plus morphine group were significantly lower than those of the placebo group (weighted mean difference (WMD) &#8722;1.75, 95% CI &#8722;2.16 to &#8722;1.33, p&lt;0.001). The VAS scores at the last follow-up time point (last VAS scores) of the bupivacaine plus morphine group were also significantly lower than those of the placebo group (WMD &#8722;1.46, 95% CI &#8722;1.63 to &#8722;1.29, p&lt;0.001). The number of patients requiring supplementary analgesia was also significantly reduced (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93, p=0.02), while there was no significant difference in the time to first analgesic request (WMD 3.46, 95% CI &#8722;1.81 to 8.72, p=0.20) or short-term side effects (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.26, p=0.29). Conclusions: The administration of single-dose intra-articular bupivacaine plus morphine after knee arthroscopic surgery is effective for pain relief, and its short-term side effects remain similar to saline placebo.</oai_dc:dc/dc:description><oai_dc:dc/dc:subject /><date
